Envision empowers creators with generative AI tools to produce stunning visual content, but it requires significant GPU power to run AI models across its product suite. Traditional cloud providers proved too expensive to meet surging user demand. Envision\u2019s mission to create a decentralized, creator-centric platform called the Envision DeAI Network required an equally innovative infrastructure solution.\\n\\nEnter Akash, the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud computing marketplace. By tapping into underutilized GPUs across a global network of providers, Akash offers on-demand scalability at significantly lower costs. This case study explores how Envision Labs integrated the Akash Supercloud to fuel its generative AI platform, overcoming growth hurdles, cutting costs, and accelerating its mission to democratize creative content generation. **After integrating Akash, Envision Labs reduced GPU spend by up to 30%.**\\n\\n## A Decentralized Solution for Growing Demand\\n\\nEnvision\u2019s product suite spans multiple AI-driven products:\\n\\n* Envision generative AI suite: Tools for creating 2D/3D images, custom-trained characters, and videos. \\n* Interactive mascots: AI-powered avatars reflecting a project or brand's distinct personality and knowledge base. \\n* On-chain IP protection: Copyright proofs are recorded on-chain, ensuring verifiable and transparent ownership. \\n* IP monetization: Built-in licensing and sales options to turn creative assets into revenue streams.\\n\\nLaunched in late December, Envision\u2019s first DeAI project rapidly took off: over 35 custom AI models were trained and deployed, collectively generating around 100,000 images in the first month. This surge in adoption underscored the necessity for large-scale GPU availability, but in a manner that supported the decentralization of Envision\u2019s DeAI network.\\n\\n## Choosing the Akash Supercloud\\n\\nTo support the expansion of its generative AI offerings, Envision prioritized the following requirements:\\n\\n1. Decentralization and permissionlessness: Avoiding reliance on a single provider aligns with the DeAI Network\u2019s core principles and ensures resilience. \\n2. Scalable GPU power: Demand for AI-driven models can spike unpredictably, particularly for custom 3D video or popular character generation, so the ability to scale is crucial to supporting Envision\u2019s operations. \\n3. Competitive pricing: Cost-effective GPU resources broaden the range of projects and communities Envision can serve at a fraction of the cost of traditional cloud providers.\\n\\nAkash fits these criteria by providing a global, open marketplace for compute. Providers worldwide bring their GPUs to the network, and projects like Envision can deploy workloads without conventional obstacles like account approvals or the need to commit to expensive reserved instances.\\n\\n## Integrating With Akash\\n\\nThe Envision Labs team experimented with [Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/) to test deployments, monitor performance, and confirm feasibility. Encouraged by the results, they shifted to a command-line interface (CLI) approach that uses a hot wallet for more direct management and integrations.\\n\\nEnvision also incorporated an autoscaling mechanism to seamlessly spin up additional Akash GPU instances when usage spikes and release them as activity tapers off. During the process, technical community members on the [Akash Discord](https://discord.akash.network) offered real-time guidance, helping Envision navigate tasks like wallet setup and transitions [between different GPU types](https://akash.network/pricing/gpus/) (for instance, H100 and A100) to balance availability with current usage.\\n\\n## Outcomes and Impact\\n\\n### Scalable GPU Usage\\n\\nEnvision relies on scaling GPUs at peak times to handle surges in image or video generation requests. This previously cost tens of thousands of dollars monthly, which was reduced by up to 30% after integrating Akash GPUs.\\n\\n### High-Volume Generations\\n\\nWith over 35 models trained and 100,000 images generated, the network\u2019s capacity to handle diverse workloads has become a significant draw for Envision\u2019s users.\\n\\n### Decentralized Resilience\\n\\nEnvision\u2019s DeAI Network is built to support several providers to maximize decentralization. Akash has remained the top platform in terms of usage, reflecting its reliability and permissionless structure.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nEnvision\u2019s roadmap includes advanced AI development, such as autonomous agents and deeper content creation explorations, which will further increase GPU needs. The DeAI Network is designed to remain flexible: different providers can join or exit, maintaining a truly decentralized environment that can absorb fluctuations in demand.\\n\\nAkash will continue to be integral to Envision's strategy well into the future. Its open and permissionless nature aligns with Envision\u2019s foundational philosophy: to build AI solutions without needing permission or facing unnecessary provider-imposed constraints.\\n\\nEnvision\u2019s experience exemplifies how Akash can fuel demanding generative AI workloads as decentralized compute evolves. This will pave the way for innovation in emerging domains, from digital avatars to large-scale video generation. The work accomplished so far demonstrates that, with the proper infrastructure, the future of AI is both globally scalable and open to all.\\n\\n[Learn more about Envision here](https://envisionlabs.io/), and join the Envision community on [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/envisionlabs_io) and [Telegram](https://t.me/EnvisionLabs)**.** \\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Envision Labs Accelerates Generative AI on Akash&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Envision was able to reduce total GPU spend by up to 30% by integrating Akash.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2025-03-05T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/envision-akash-x.CilT9q7K.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/envision-labs-accelerates-generative-ai-on-akash/envision-akash-x.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-akash-provider-console/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-akash-provider-console&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;by [Jigar Patel](https://x.com/pateljigar053), [Deval Patel](https://x.com/Deval_Vora), and [Anil Murty](https://x.com/_Anil_Murty_)\\n\\nThe Akash core team is excited to announce the general availability of Akash Provider Console. Akash Provider Console aims to be the easiest and most elegant way for compute providers (including datacenter operators) of all sizes to become Akash Providers, as well as the primary way that existing Akash Providers view and manage resources on the network.\\n\\n## Why was Akash Provider Console built?\\n\\nAkash has experienced significant growth over the past year, primarily driven by demand from AI workloads. This demand has led to many new GPU providers joining the network&nbsp;\u2014 growing [GPU capacity on the network by over 600% and CPU capacity by about 250%](https://stats.akash.network).\\n\\n| ![GPU Usage on Akash](./pc-1.png) | ![CPU Usage on Akash](./pc-2.png) |\\n| :---- | :---- |\\n\\nWhile that growth is impressive, Akash expects to grow much more on both the demand and supply side in 2025 and beyond. More importantly, in working with many providers throughout 2023 and 2024, the Akash core team realized that there is a significant number of datacenter operators who would like to be part of the network but do not have the technical expertise or the resources to onboard their servers and maintain an Akash provider. The desire to prioritize solving that problem drove the [merger of the PraetorApp team with the Akash Network core team in 2024](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/525) and subsequently led to the creation of Akash Provider Console. \\n\\nAkash Provider Console adds key functionality that was missing from PraetorApp (including the requirement to have a Kubernetes cluster pre-configured), along with improving the overall user experience (UX). It also updates the branding and UI design to be consistent with the Akash Deploy Console. Most importantly, Akash Provider Console provides a platform for the core team to continue quickly iterating on new features that will attract new providers by improving the provider setup process.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the features included in this initial release of Akash Provider Console.\\n\\n## Key Features\\n\\n### Streamlined Onboarding\\nNew datacenter operators looking to bring their compute resources to Akash are presented with an easy-to-follow onboarding process. \\n\\n![Akash Provider Console onboarding](./pc-3.png)\\n\\nClicking **`Create Provider`** leads the user through the setup process step-by-step, starting with specifying the number of servers.\\n\\n![Akash Provider Console](./pc-4.png)\\n\\n### Automated Kubernetes Install\\nAkash Provider Console also removes the burden of manually installing Kubernetes. To get started, a new provider simply provides virtual machines, and Akash Provider Console does the rest. This includes deciding how many \u201ccontrol nodes\u201d and how many \u201cworker nodes\u201d to set up based on the total server count.\\n\\n![Kubernetes install in Akash Provider Console](./pc-5.png)\\n\\n### Dashboard for Leases &amp; Earnings\\nOnce a provider is up and running, the default homepage view in Akash Provider Console displays a dashboard of the provider resources and overall usage. This includes revenue earned, leases, used/available resources by type (GPU, CPU, memory, and storage). The dashboard also features an activity log that displays key changes made to the provider during or after setup.\\n\\n![Akash Provider Console Dashboard](./pc-6.png)\\n\\n### Status &amp; Control Node Access\\nAt the bottom of the left sidebar is an **Overall (online/offline) Status Indicator**, an **Audit Status indicator** (if the provider is not currently audited, a link will be shown to submit an audit request form), and a button to **Connect with the Control Node**. \\n\\n![Akash Provider Console status indicator](./pc-7.png)\\n\\n### Deployment Management\\nThe Deployments page shows an overall count of workloads running on the provider and per-deployment information, including the owner wallet, the spend, and a count of leased resources.\\n\\n![Deployments](./pc-8.png)\\n\\n### Pricing Management\\nThe pricing page is where providers can view and update pricing by resource type. The page also estimates what the provider can expect to earn monthly (assuming 80% utilization). To help providers price their infrastructure competitively, a comparative benchmark is provided based on other similar providers\u2019 pricing on the network. \\n\\n![](./pc-9.png)\\n\\n### Attributes Management\\nThe Attributes page lets the provider manager add, delete, or edit the list of attributes configured on the provider. Correct attribute configuration is essential for the provider to be discovered by users via Akash Deploy Console.\\n\\n![](./pc-10.png)\\n\\n### Persistent Storage Configuration &amp; Management\\nConfiguring Persistent Storage can also be done from within the interface by navigating to the corresponding page via the side menu \\n\\n![](./pc-11.png)\\n\\n### Provider Maintenance Features\\nThe Settings page provides maintenance tools to restart the provider, upgrade its software, and update the provider hostname.\\n\\n![](./pc-12.png)\\n\\n## Getting Started\\nThe Akash core team and community can\u2019t wait to hear from providers on the network about what they think of Akash Provider Console and more importantly, are excited to continue building features that improve the provider experience as they support workloads on Akash. Feedback is always welcomed.\\n\\nGet started with Akash Provider Console here: [provider-console.akash.network](https://provider-console.akash.network/)\\n\\n[Explore the Akash Roadmap](https://akash.network/roadmap/2025/) to learn more about upcoming features and initiatives, and [sign up for the newsletter](https://akashnet.typeform.com/to/awKX5bPw) to stay up to date with the latest from Akash.\\n\\nIf you are interested in becoming an Akash provider or interested in deploying on Akash, [reach out to the core team.](https://share.hsforms.com/1gQOaeJXgQ-GMc7MnsTOmsAsaima)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing: Akash Provider Console&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The Akash core team is excited to announce the general availability of Akash Provider Console&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2025-02-18T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Anil Murty&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/pc-main.vfOqC1xb.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/introducing-akash-provider-console/pc-main.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-developer-specific-workflows-in-akash-console/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-developer-specific-workflows-in-akash-console&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;In December last year, Akash [launched credit card payments in Akash Console](https://akash.network/blog/introducing-credit-card-payments-in-akash-console/). This eliminates one of the most significant barriers faced by (mainstream) developers trying to use Akash Network. The next hurdle many developers face is the challenge of having to containerize their applications and knowing how to create a [Stack Definition Language (SDL)](https://akash.network/docs/getting-started/stack-definition-language/) file for deployment onto Akash Network. To this end, Akash Network has also added a new user experience within [Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/) that features workflows for four distinct user types who make up the primary user groups for Akash Network.\\n\\n![Developer workflows in Akash Console](./dw-1.png)\\n\\n# Four workflows for four types of users\\nIn speaking with many existing cloud IaaS and PaaS users and onboarding several customers, the Akash core team and community discovered that these users tend to come from multiple different backgrounds, in terms of their technical skills and the products and services they used in the past and use today. At the same time, there is a lot of nuance to this, which can result in 10s of different workflows, asking the question: \u201cHow Akash savvy is the user?\u201d which results in bucketing Akash users into four primary user groups.\\n\\nNote that \u201cAkash Savviness\u201d is the willingness of the user to deal with things like understanding the infrastructure needs of their applications at a detailed level and being able to package their application or service into a form that allows for deployment onto Akash Network.\\n\\n| **Developer Type** | **Akash Savviness** | **Desired Workflow** |\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\n| Web Developers (Including AI/ ML app developers and Data Scientists) | Low | Would like to be able not to have to worry about infrastructure selection, provisioning, dockerization, or \u201cAkashization\u201d at all Typically use Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) products like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku. |\\n| Ops/ Infra Engineers | Low-Med | Are used to being able to just get a Virtual Machine with their SSH pub keys copied into it so that they can SSH from a terminal and copy/ run what they need. Are fine specifying infrastructure requirements (number of GPUs/ CPUs, amount of Memory &amp; Storage, locations, etc) at a very detailed level Typically use Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) products like AWS EC2, Azure-VM, GCE-VM or Digital Ocean droplet |\\n| DevOps Engineers | Med-High | Are comfortable dockerizing applications and building deployment workflows (for CI/ CD, etc), specifying infrastructure requirements, and setting up automatic infrastructure scaling with load balancers. They can figure out how to write an AkashSDL for their needs but there\u2019s a potential b Typically, they may use managed Kubernetes services (like AWS EKS) or may obtain Virtual Machines and run their own Kubernetes clusters with applications and services deployed as containers |\\n| Akash Champions | Very High | These users understand how Akash works and likely have an SDL file ready (or a repository of SDL files) that they have deployed before and want to deploy again as quickly as possible. |\\n\\nAkash Console has now built workflows to help each of those four user types get started with less friction than before by trying to provide them with a workflow that looks familiar to what they are used to. Here are the four workflow types and how they map to the user groups outlined above. Each of these workflows correspond with one of the four options after clicking `Deploy` in Akash Console.\\n\\n| **Developer Type** | **Akash Console Workflow** |\\n| :---- | ----- |\\n| Web Developers | Build &amp; Deploy |\\n| Ops/ Infra Engineers | Launch Container - VM |\\n| DevOps Engineers | Run Custom Container |\\n| Akash Champions | Upload an SDL |\\n\\nLet\u2019s look at each of those workflows individually.\\n\\n## Build &amp; Deploy Workflow\\nThis workflow (as the name suggests) takes care of building AND deploying user applications on Akash and also supports redeploying on a Git commit (PR merge) and rolling back to a past deployed version (if there are issues with a deployment). This workflow currently only supports NodeJS (javascript/ react) based applications with other programming languages (like Python and Ruby) planned for the future. \\n\\nUsers start by clicking the \u201cBuild &amp; Deploy\u201d tile from the [new deployment](https://console.akash.network/new-deployment) page in Console which brings up a configuration screen that looks like this:\\n\\n![Build and deploy workflow](./dw-2.png)\\n\\nOn that screen, the user starts by specifying the location where their application code resides. They can do this by either authenticating with their VCS provider (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) account or choosing the \u201cThird-Party Git Repository\u201d option where they can enter the URL of their public Git repository. Once connected the user can pick a repository and a branch, as shown below.\\n\\n![Select a repository](./dw-3.png)\\n\\nThey can then (optionally) modify the build &amp; install configuration and any environment variables that their application may need.\\n\\n![Build and install configuration](./dw-4.png)\\n\\nNote that there is also an \u201cAuto Deploy\u201d option, which is checked by default. When checked this will automatically rebuild and redeploy a new version of the app when a change is made to the connected code repository (typically through a PR merge and git commit).\\n\\nThe last part of this configuration screen lets the user modify the specs of the build server that will be provisioned on Akash to build and deploy the application. The user can change this, but this is typically for advanced users who know their application\u2019s infrastructure requirements.\\n\\nOnce the user has chosen a provider to deploy to, they\u2019ll be able to see logs that indicate that the application source code is being cloned onto the build server (provisioned on the chosen provider). \\n\\n![Create react app](./dw-5.png)\\n\\nOnce built, the react application is served, as shown in the last portion of the logs. \\n\\n![Final logs](./dw-6.png)\\n\\nThe \u201cLeases\u201d tab displays the URL that can be used to access the application.\\n\\n![Access the URL through the leases tab](./dw-7.png)\\n\\nMerging a pull request into the code repository connected to the console will trigger an automatic re-build and re-deploy of the application, which can be observed in the logs.\\n\\n![Merging a PR](./dw-8.png)\\n\\nLastly, rollbacks are supported. This feature can be accessed from the \u201cupdate\u201d tab. Clicking \u201cSelect\u201d allows users to choose a specific past application version to roll back to. This is useful for quickly reverting to a previous version of the application if a new deployment has issues.\\n\\n![Rollbacks](./dw-9.png)\\n\\n## Container VM Workflow\\nThis workflow is for users who typically like to work with Virtual Machines. They do this by having the compute provider copy their public SSH key into the machine. Then, SSH into the machine with the corresponding private SSH key, copy any files or data they need to, and build and deploy any apps they need to, pretty much like they would on their machine. \\n\\nThe challenge with enabling this on Akash is that because Akash uses Kubernetes to manage workloads, all workloads need to be docker containers to run on Akash. This means it was left to the user to figure out how to set up a plain Linux container with the Linux distribution of their choice and how to connect to get the command line on that running container instance so that they could copy things into it.\\n\\nThis has been solved in two ways:\\n\\n1. Building container images that bundle in an SSH daemon. The Akash community maintains a few of these in the awesome-akash repository: [https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/base-ssh](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/base-ssh) \\n2. Building a workflow in Akash Console that lets the user choose one of those base images and be able to input an SSH public key (that will be copied into the base Linux container). In fact, if the user does not have an SSH key, Console will generate one for them.\\n\\nUsers start by choosing the \u201cLaunch Container-VM\u201d option from the new deployment screen, which brings them to this screen where they can select a base Linux image and provide an SSH public key.\\n\\n![Launch Container-VM](./dw-10.png)\\n\\nOnce the user clicks Create Deployment, chooses a provider, and deploys, they can SSH into the Linux container with their SSH key. Instructions for doing so are also provided in the \u201cLeases\u201d tab:\\n\\n![SSH into the container](./dw-11.png)\\n\\n## Custom Container Workflow\\nThis workflow is designed for users who have a dockerized application or can dockerize their application. Users start by clicking the \u201cCustom Container\u201d tile from the new deployment page in Akash Console. This brings them to a page that looks like this:\\n\\n![Custom container workflow](./dw-12.png)\\n\\nThe user also has the option to choose a privately hosted container image by selecting the \u201cprivate\u201d option and entering authentication information for the private container registry.\\n\\n![Privately hosted container](./dw-13.png)\\n\\nOnce that is done, the rest of the workflow is like any deployment on Akash.\\n\\n## Upload SDL option\\nLast but not least important is the upload SDL option for the \u201cAkash Champion.\u201d As you would imagine, clicking the \u201cupload SDL\u201d button allows the user to select an SDL (`deploy.yaml`) file and leads them to a page where they can make any changes and deploy it.\\n\\n## Community-contributed Templates\\nIn addition to the user-specific workflows noted above, Akash Console features a rich collection of community-contributed templates for users who want less customization and want to get started with just a few clicks. \\n\\nThere are a few templates that are featured up front on the new-deployment page that are primarily focused on launching AI inference services using leading open-source AI models like [Meta\u2019s Llama Models](https://www.llama.com/), [Falcon-7B](https://falconllm.tii.ae/falcon-models.html), [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image), and [Google\u2019s BERT](https://research.google/pubs/bert-pre-training-of-deep-bidirectional-transformers-for-language-understanding/).\\n\\n![Explore templates](./dw-14.png)\\n\\nFurther, clicking the \u201cView All Templates\u201d link takes the user to a categorized library of reference templates, including databases, blockchain nodes, games, and more.

These companies control who gets access, how much they pay, and what content they can distribute.\\n\\nSuch power leads to [oligopolization](https://www.onsip.com/voip-resources/industry-news-trends/how-cloud-computing-companies-created-an-oligopoly) of the industry, stifling [open-source innovators](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/cloud/articles/aws-elastic-feud/) and silencing [political dissent](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55615214). They impose an invisible tax that all of us have to pay without having a say in how it is spent.\\n\\nAdam and I founded [Overclock Labs](https://ovrclk.com/), the organization that gave birth to Akash, in 2015 when it became obvious that so much power should not be held by the few \u2014 cloud computing infrastructure needed to be democratized.\\n\\nWe believe [access](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/25/2023/the-ai-booms-chip-shortage-has-an-unlikely-hero-the-blockchain) to computing infrastructure should be a public good.\\n\\nInspired by Bitcoin's decentralization of money, we chose to decentralize the cloud, to ensure the critical fabric of modern digital society is a public utility, like the air we breathe and the water we drink.\\n\\nWe built Akash so humanity retains its right to compute, freedom from censorship, and liberty of free thought.\\n\\nBuilding a decentralized network means that we, the developers, have no control over the network once it's launched. Updating the software once it's deployed becomes extremely time-consuming as we need consensus from individuals that actually run the nodes, which is not necessarily its builders. Building in the open means being extremely transparent, which leaves little room for mistakes.\\n\\nWe chose not to take shortcuts and to do it the right way from the get-go. We chose to be open-source and decentralized from the start because we believe doing it any other way will create a culture of complacency where companies that launched with closed-source codebases and complete control over their network rarely open-source their code or relinquish control. A community's culture becomes nearly impossible to change once established, hence it was critical for us to start with an open and permissionless culture.\\n\\nWe launched Akash Mainnet 1 in 2020 to establish a base level foundational security to launch the Platform (Mainnet 2) in March of 2021. This was the first time in history that cloud computing could be accessible with full self custody. In 2022, we introduced several other firsts like high-performance storage and IP discovery. In 2023, we introduced accelerated computing (GPUs) to enable AI use cases, marking another first in history where GPUs can be accessible on a non-custodial cloud. In 2024, we optimized for user experience that resulted in over 10x growth in on-chain revenue. We're now excited to share the next phase of Akash as we transition from a resource network to a services network, realizing the vision of the supercloud.\\n\\nAs we designed our roadmap, we laid out key priorities:\\n\\n1. Improve client experience to eliminate the need for support.\\n2. Increase adoption by eliminating barriers and adding capabilities.\\n3. Increase AKT demand to strengthen Akash economy.\\n4. Push boundaries of cloud technologies and enhance open source experience.\\n\\nSome highlights from the roadmap:\\n\\n**Sovereign AI Agents**: Akash is the only general-purpose decentralized network that allows AI Agents to operate with sovereignty at scale. With [confidentiality](/roadmap/aep-12/) coming this year, Akash is well-positioned to be the premier decentralized hosting network for AI agents.\\n\\nWith generative AI, we see AI being helpful in making us smarter. With AI agents, AI will make us much faster. There is little doubt that AI agents are the future of applications.\\n\\n**On-chain Provider Incentives**: In 2024, we observed that demand increased fairly linearly as supply increased in the several provider [incentive pilots](/roadmap/aep-26/) we executed. In 2025, we bring [incentives on-chain](/roadmap/aep-53/) to unlock network effects-driven supply growth.\\n\\n**Sovereign Services**: The [Managed Service Market (MSM)](/roadmap/aep-11/) strengthens the Akash ecosystem by unlocking a new wave of service providers and strengthens AKT. Services enable creators of software to generate meaningful income while sustaining and improving their work and keeping software open. Today, the value capture is at a massive imbalance where Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are the biggest benefactors. MSM balances this asymmetry.\\n\\n**Improved Developer Experience**: Increasing distribution is a key aspect for gaining adoption and core improvements in developer experience when integrating with Akash, remove friction points for developers to interate Akash into their core offerings\\n\\n**Akash at Home**: We believe personal AI will run on home servers for privacy and security. [Akash at Home](/roadmap/aep-60/) aims to use spare computing power in homes to host AI workloads and bring Akash to home users.\\n\\n**Access Akash's roadmap at [akash.network/roadmap](https://akash.network/roadmap)**\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Roadmap 2025&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing Akash's Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond as the Network Expands to Agent-Centric Infrastructure&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2025-01-14T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;AI &amp; ML&quot;],[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;AI &amp; ML&quot;],[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Greg Osuri&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.Dxn8gnCF.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/roadmap-2025/banner-image.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;scaling-the-supercloud/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;scaling-the-supercloud&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n*A year of growth and adoption for Akash in 2024 and the vision for 2025 and beyond*\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is the decade that will define the next century. Last year, we wrote about two competing forces: one in favor of slowing (or even reversing) progress and another stronger force pushing for accelerating progress. As 2024 unfolded, the world seemed to tip decisively toward acceleration. We see it manifested in open infrastructures, the push for abundant energy, and the belief that broader access to compute benefits all of society. Akash is positioned entirely for a world that demands acceleration.\\n\\nOverclock Labs, the creators and largest contributors to Akash, has long championed a radically open approach to building permissionless infrastructure. This ethic is rooted in solid fundamentals, which genuinely matter when building for the future. 2024 was the year that tested and ultimately affirmed our open approach to development. From record-breaking network growth to strategic integrations, from expansions into new regions to steadily climbing adoption, every milestone was propelled by the same undercurrent \u2014 open collaboration that thrives in public.\\n\\nBelow, we\u2019ll cover the achievements that defined this banner year and examine where they lead us next. Beyond the perpetual hype cycle that often pervades AI and crypto, there is tangible, foundational progress at work that keeps propelling Akash, both as a network and a community, onto an ever-broadening global stage.\\n\\nHere is the story of this moment in time: how momentum gathered in favor of acceleration, the fundamentals that give Akash real staying power, and the road ahead through 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n## A Year of Foundational Network Growth in 2024\\n\\n2024 was a pivotal year for Akash, underpinned by soaring adoption and significant growth on nearly every key metric. These achievements further expanded an already thriving ecosystem, cementing Akash\u2019s position as a reliable, cost-effective, and truly permissionless network for compute.\\n\\n### Significant Growth in Network Metrics\\n\\nAkash experienced a surge in usage throughout 2024, most vividly reflected by its order-of-magnitude increase in USD-denominated spend (including AKT and USDC spend in a single metric). On January 1st, 2024, the network registered approximately $1,299 in daily spend, which increased to $11,038 by December 31st, 2024, representing a **749% increase**.\\n\\nThe growing daily spend also increased the trajectory of cumulative network spending. By October 27th, 2024, Akash had surpassed $1 million in cumulative spend. As of this writing, that number has climbed to $1.62 million. This represents a **609% increase** in total network spending over the year, underscoring market demand for compute.\\n\\n![Monthly Spend on Akash](./scaling-the-supercloud-1.png)\\n\\nSeveral factors contributed to these gains, including a **391% increase** in average daily new leases, comparing the 2-month periods before and after the [launch of credit card payments in Akash Console](https://akash.network/blog/introducing-credit-card-payments-in-akash-console/) on October 27th. By improving the network user experience for those more accustomed to traditional payment options, Akash significantly broadened its total addressable audience, quickly reflected in the network metrics across the board. Growth metrics from October, [announced on social channels](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1845976505853071864) and backed by [real-time data](https://stats.akash.network), further signaled that this momentum is built on fundamentals. As more users recognize the value of Akash\u2019s unique, open-source approach to cloud compute, the network\u2019s growth trajectory appears poised to continue well into 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n![Average daily spend on Akash before and after the launch of credit card payments](./scaling-the-supercloud-2.png)\\n\\n[Network data from Q3 2024](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1845976505853071864) tells a story of evolving quality and quantity on Akash. Comparing Q3 2024 to Q3 2023, app deployments (leases) **grew by 1,729%**, while the average fee per lease **increased by 688%**. This signals that users are deploying more often and are willing to pay significantly higher fees for workloads that stay online longer and demand greater compute resources. Compared to Q2 2024, the average fee per lease **increased by 192%** \u2014 jumping from $6.42 to $18.75. This indicates that resource-intensive deployments drive revenue, an indicator that GPU-intensive workloads for AI and machine learning development are driving real growth for the Akash Supercloud.\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, the momentum of network growth is poised to accelerate even further. The core team is rolling out new features to boost user acquisition and retention, reflecting the network\u2019s commitment to meeting growing demand. These insights are derived from on-chain data indexed by [stats.akash.network](https://stats.akash.network), with verifiable transactions on [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/akash). This transparency&nbsp;enables anyone to review, audit, and validate network activity.\\n\\nIn December 2023, [AkashChat](https://chat.akash.network), a free-to-use chat interface that allows users to interact with the leading open-source AI models, was launched to the public. Following the launch and substantial growth in usage throughout early 2024, AkashChat expanded to offer direct [API access](https://chatapi.akash.network/) to the underlying open-source AI models hosted on the Akash Supercloud. By the end of the year, the [AkashChat API had processed over **15 billion tokens**](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aakashnet_%20akash%20chat%20api&src=typed_query). The API currently offers access to Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B, and 405B), Llama 3.2 3B, and Llama 3.3 70B, with Deepseek-V3 coming soon (Deepseek is currently the most capable open-source AI model available today, directly rivaling the [performance of 3.5 Sonnet and GPT 4o](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3)).\\n\\nExpanding on the early success of AkashChat, the Akash core team built and launched [AkashGen](https://gen.akash.network/), an easy-to-use interface powered by [Stable Diffusion 3.5](https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stable-diffusion-3-5) that allows users to create AI-generated images. The launch of AkashGen was met with significant attention on social media, with the launch announcement achieving over 250,000 impressions. AkashGen saw an immediate spike in usage with sustained image generation output over time.\\n\\n### The Key Network Integrations of 2024\\n\\nThroughout 2024, a wave of new entrants joined the Akash ecosystem, each drawn by the platform\u2019s unique open-source nature and compute resources. From AI-focused companies and projects to academic research teams, these integrations underscore Akash\u2019s growing appeal as a true Supercloud that is open-source and community-led while offering the resources needed to power production applications and cutting-edge academic research. Each integration brings Akash to a new set of users and demonstrates how strategic integrations can accelerate broader adoption.\\n\\n#### Brev.dev\\n\\nIn April, [Brev.dev](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/launchables/) integrated the Akash Supercloud to expand its platform compute offerings by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs from Akash. This integration increased demand for GPUs on Akash while giving Brev users a wider selection of GPUs at a range of price points. Brev and Akash also co-sponsored a booth at NVIDIA GTC in San Jose&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;and only a few months later, [Brev was acquired by NVIDIA](https://x.com/NaderLikeLadder/status/1813286240093151412).\\n\\n#### Venice.ai\\n\\n[Venice.ai](http://Venice.ai) integrated with Akash to [access GPUs for inference of the leading open-source AI models](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1838650155987566899). By leveraging the Akash Supercloud, Venice.ai gave users access to the most capable AI models (including Llama 3.1 405B) through a permissionless and privacy-preserving chat application. The integration demonstrated impressive performance metrics, handling hundreds of thousands of user requests and processing billions of tokens in the months following the integration.\\n\\n#### Passage.io\\n\\n[Passage.io](http://Passage.io) tapped into the Akash Supercloud to render immersive virtual worlds and significantly reduced compute costs. By leveraging Akash's decentralized marketplace, [Passage reduced cloud computing costs by an average of 50%](https://akash.network/blog/passage-reduces-cloud-spend-by-50-with-akash/) (up to 70% in some cases) compared to traditional providers. This integration enabled Passage to maintain its zero-compromise approach to browser-based virtual experiences while significantly reducing infrastructure costs. This integration further validates the scale and cost-effectiveness of Akash's permissionless model and positions Passage to accelerate platform development and feature expansion for creators worldwide.\\n\\n#### Prime Intellect\\n\\n[Prime Intellect](https://www.primeintellect.ai/) expanded its GPU marketplace by [incorporating Akash\u2019s wide range of high-performance GPUs](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1807865087161405460), including NVIDIA H100, A100, A6000, and more.

The upcoming detailed roadmap for 2025 and beyond will introduce new features and improvements designed to support increasingly sophisticated AI workloads while maintaining the network's core values of transparency, open development, and permissionlessness.\\n\\n### Connecting the Decentralized AI Community\\n\\nIn the months ahead, the Akash core team and community will be opening a DeAI space in Austin, TX (collaborating with [Professor Sriram Vishwanath](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/sriram-vishwanath) from the University of Texas at Austin, and [Manifold Labs](https://www.manifold.inc/)) to bring decentralized AI builders together in a physical community space to share ideas, get access to compute, and more. The space was soft-launched in late 2024, and will officially open in the coming months. The DeAI space represents Akash's investment in fostering AI development through in-person collaboration, and will create a vibrant local ecosystem that bridges the digital and physical worlds.\\n\\nThe DeAI Space represents more than just a co-working environment, it's a practical demonstration of how decentralized communities can come together to collaborate.\\n\\n### Collaboration With Academic Institutions and the Research Community\\n\\nAcademic collaboration remains a cornerstone of Akash's commitment to advancing the field of decentralized and permissionless compute. The collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin continues to explore new approaches to verifiable compute. At the same time, ongoing research initiatives drive progress in areas such as distributed AI training and edge computing optimization.\\n\\nThese research initiatives help validate Akash's approach to decentralized infrastructure while contributing to the broader academic discourse on the future of cloud computing. By bridging the gap between academic research and practical implementation, Akash ensures that theoretical advances in distributed systems and AI can quickly translate into real-world applications.\\n\\n### Market Expansion and Adoption\\n\\nAkash's growing institutional recognition throughout 2024, including attention from major research firms and traditional finance platforms, sets the stage for broader market adoption in 2025. As organizations increasingly seek alternatives to centralized cloud providers, Akash's proven track record of reliability and performance positions it as a compelling option.\\n\\nThe platform's support for traditional payment methods and non-custodial wallet transactions removes barriers to entry for organizations looking to experiment and scale with decentralized infrastructure. This hybrid approach, combined with competitive pricing and permissionless access, makes Akash an increasingly attractive option for organizations of all sizes.\\n\\n### Building for Sustainable Growth\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025 and beyond, the focus for Akash remains on building sustainable, long-term value for its community and the larger permissionless compute space. The network's open-source foundation and commitment to transparent development provide a robust framework for continued advancement. By maintaining this commitment while expanding capabilities and improving accessibility, Akash can lead the next evolution of cloud computing.\\n\\nThe combination of expanding infrastructure capabilities, enhanced user experience, and strong community engagement creates a robust foundation for growth. As demand for AI compute continues to rise and organizations seek more flexible, cost-effective infrastructure solutions, Akash's decentralized marketplace model becomes increasingly relevant.\\n\\n### The Path Forward Into 2025\\n\\nThe achievements of 2024 have demonstrated the viability and value of decentralized computing at scale. As we move into 2025, Akash stands ready to capitalize on this momentum, driving advancement in cloud infrastructure while maintaining its commitment to openness and transparency.

[Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=organic_blog&utm_campaign=cc_payment_launch) now accepts credit cards to pay for compute resources on the network. This is a significant step in making permissionless cloud compute accessible to everyone. Until now, using Akash was accessible only with AKT or USDC, requiring a non-custodial wallet for storing and transacting on-chain. While crypto-native users are comfortable with this system, many developers and teams need more familiar payment options. Starting today, users can easily pay for Akash deployments with a credit card.\\n\\n## Making Permissionless Compute Simple\\nThe new payment system is built right into Akash Console with a Stripe integration. Users can instantly add funds to their accounts, manage active deployments, and monitor spending \u2014 all through a familiar console interface. This allows users to choose what works best: credit card payments or managing funds with a non-custodial wallet. Whether it's an enterprise that needs standard payment methods for compliance, a developer just starting with permissionless compute, or a team moving to decentralized infrastructure \u2014 Akash Console now supports their preferred payment method.\\n\\n## Bringing the Akash Supercloud to Everyone\\nAdding credit card payments is about more than convenience. It's about making decentralized cloud compute practical for mainstream adoption. By combining the permissionless nature of blockchain with familiar payment tools, Akash is creating a cloud platform that brings compute to market in a truly decentralized manner, with easy-to-use applications that work for everyone. This development breaks down yet another barrier between traditional and permissionless infrastructure, marking a crucial step toward widespread adoption.\\n\\nAs part of the new payment system, new Akash Console users can now explore the Supercloud\u2019s capabilities without the need to add any payment method with a new Free Trial tier. The Free Trial provides $10 in credit to deploy an application and test the full capabilities of the network. This hands-on experience lets developers validate Akash's performance and cost advantages before committing to adding funds to their accounts.

While they have leveraged compute from multiple major providers, tapping into the Akash GPU marketplace this year has unlocked new potential for streamed experiences. The Passage team has seen price reductions averaging 50%, and up to 70%, compared to traditional GPU providers.\\n\\n## Creating Immersive Virtual Worlds on Passage\\nThe Passage platform makes these immersive, virtual experiences accessible to anyone. Teams, creators, and educators can gather in a Passage event without downloads, apps, or load times. The platform is integrated with Unreal Engine 5, allowing anyone to create and interact with the world's most powerful gaming engine without any hardware requirements. In addition to the expansive creative tools available via the UE5 integration, Passage offers out-of-the-box tools for virtual collaboration and events.\\n\\n## The Challenge: Cost of No \u201cCompromises\u201d\\nPassage has made zero compromises when it comes to accessibility or immersion. The graphics are the best possible across any platform, and anyone can join instantly from any browser on any device. The one compromise required for this unique experience is cost: Passage has removed the compute barrier from the end-user, which means the platform bears the cost.\\n\\nThese costs limit the applications they can offer and the verticals they can address. GPU compute cost is a key consideration for many opportunities with Passage.\\n\\n\\&quot;Our fundamental thesis with Passage is that GPU compute will soon be a commodity, just like video has become on the web,\\&quot; says Lex Avellino, co-founder of Passage. \\&quot;Video used to be prohibitive as a format on the web, and now it's ubiquitous.\u201d\\n\\n## The Solution: The Akash Supercloud\\nSeeking alternatives to traditional cloud providers, Passage discovered the Akash Supercloud and its open-source compute marketplace. The model was compelling: providers compete to offer GPU resources in an open marketplace, which creates price competition that ultimately drives down costs. Initial tests showed they could maintain, or in some cases improve, performance while significantly reducing the total cost of compute.\\n\\n\\&quot;Akash gave us exactly what we needed: high-performance GPUs at 50% lower cost,\\&quot; says Arel Avellino, co-founder of Passage. \\&quot;The savings and flexibility have significantly opened doors for us to expand. Even if we were to reserve GPUs on AWS for an entire year, we would not see the same cost savings as Akash provides. We're now able to offer better value to our users while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital experiences and events.\\&quot;\\n\\n## Implementation and Results\\nPassage began by migrating a portion of their GPU workloads to Akash. The initial results exceeded expectations \u2014 render speeds matched or exceeded their previous cloud provider while costs dropped dramatically. After validating performance across diverse scenarios and world types, they committed to greatly expanding their usage of the Akash Supercloud.\\n\\nThe migration process proved straightforward. Using Akash's deployment tools, Passage's engineering team transferred their existing workloads and implemented automated scaling to handle demand fluctuations. Within weeks, they had achieved a fully operational virtual world rendered entirely on GPUs accessed through Akash, delivering improved performance at a fraction of the cost.\\n\\n\u201cPassage proves what's possible with decentralized cloud infrastructure. They were able to reduce their cloud spend by up to 70%, with an average cost savings of 50%, while running virtual worlds on the highest-demand NVIDIA GPUs. This is exactly why Akash was built,\u201d says Greg Osuri, Founder of Akash.\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\nThe dramatic reduction in cloud costs has transformed Passage's growth trajectory. With infrastructure spending no longer a limiting factor, the company can invest more heavily in platform development and new features for creators.\\n\\n\\&quot;Akash sets us up perfectly for our next phase of growth,\\&quot; says Passage CEO Arel Avellino. \\&quot;Instead of managing infrastructure costs, we can focus on building the tools our creators need. As we prepare for our closed beta release, we believe the efficiency of Akash's marketplace gives us a competitive edge to take over the digital events space.\\&quot;\\n\\n## Learn more about Passage\\nTo experience Passage, you can hop into their [Discord](https://discord.gg/passage) for weekly community calls hosted in the platform, or sign up for early access at [passage.io/elite-alpha-signup](http://passage.io/elite-alpha-signup). &quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Passage Reduces Cloud Spend by 50% With Akash&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Passage empowers brands and creators to host engaging, immersive virtual events that captivate audiences and foster real connection.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2024-11-26T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/passage-on-akash.DOLRhNJl.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/passage-reduces-cloud-spend-by-50-with-akash/passage-on-akash.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;achieving-decentralized-physical-state-consensus-with-witness-chain-on-akash/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;achieving-decentralized-physical-state-consensus-with-witness-chain-on-akash&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;[Witness Chain](https://www.witnesschain.com/) is transforming blockchains by bridging the cyber-physical divide by introducing a verifiable observation layer that captures and authenticates real-world attributes. Through a network of \\&quot;Watchtowers,\\&quot; which are nodes that actively witness and validate real-time data from the physical world, Witness Chain ensures that essential attributes like location, connectivity, and compute are not only recorded but verifiably accurate.\\n\\nThis process of recording and verification is achieved through protocols that achieve consensus on physical state, such as Proof of Location, Proof of Bandwidth, and Proof of Diligence. These proofs are secured by over $8 billion in restaked ETH on Eigenlayer, which makes it prohibitively costly to manipulate an asset\u2019s location or other physical attributes.\\n\\n## Enabling Proof of Location\\nProof of Location (PoL) is a core proof in Witness Chain. PoL is a decentralized protocol designed to verify the physical location of any smart asset. The verification process involves a watchtower node network that performs internet telemetry-based delay measurements to validate the asset's location. The asset acts as a prover, and the watchtower nodes act as beacons, using cryptographic pings to determine the delay between themselves and the asset. \\nThese real-world witnesses are combined in a byzantine-fault-tolerant way to accurately determine location. Through protocols like these, Witness Chain is expanding the scope of what blockchains can do, building a foundation that will enable trustless and transparent applications across industries ranging from logistics to finance.\\n\\n## Integrating Witness Chain with Akash\\nThe integration between Witness Chain and Akash marks a significant step towards decentralizing the infrastructure behind the Proof of Location (PoL) protocol. By leveraging Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud, Witness Chain can deploy and operate Watchtower nodes, which are essential for validating real-world attributes, in a fully decentralized, scalable, and cost-efficient manner.\\n\\nThis integration enables Witness Chain to leverage Akash\u2019s secure and reliable compute resources for its watchtower nodes, which conduct cryptographic pings to confirm an asset\u2019s physical location and connectivity. Through Akash, the network of watchtower nodes becomes even more resilient and censorship-resistant, supporting Witness Chain\u2019s goal of creating a verifiable observation layer for real-world attributes.\\n\\nIn addition, this integration paves the way for Akash to explore PoL as a potential tool for measuring and validating the decentralization of its own cloud network. By leveraging PoL to verify the physical distribution of Akash nodes, both platforms can set a higher standard of transparency, ensuring that Akash remains resistant to centralization while providing reliable cloud resources.\\n\\n## Running a Witness Chain Watchtower on Akash\\nThis is a step-by-step guide for successfully running a Witness Chain watchtower from Akash Console.\\n\\n### Register with Witness Chain\\nThe first step in running a watchtower with Akash is registering the address on the Witness Chain network.

Whether users choose Brev.dev for AI deployments, FLock.io for AI model training, or Morpheus for AI development, they can seamlessly tap into Akash's GPU infrastructure.\\n\\nBy integrating widely across many platforms, Akash can reach new cohorts of users and expand the network's reach significantly. This strategic approach enhances user convenience and drives the adoption of the Akash Supercloud across a wide range of developer communities, researchers, and startups. As more platforms integrate with Akash, the Supercloud becomes an increasingly accessible and versatile solution for accelerating AI development.\\n\\n## Get Started with an Akash GPU Cluster on Prime Intellect\\n\\nTo start with an Akash GPU deployment via Prime Intellect, head to [primeintellect.ai](http://primeintellect.ai) and look for the Akash logo on the GPU provider selection page of the GPU cluster setup process.\\n\\nTo connect with Akash, follow the network on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/akashnet_) and [sign up to hear about the latest announcements and updates](https://akt.fyi/3kpRwVM).\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Prime Intellect Integrates Permissionless Akash GPUs&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Today, high-performance GPUs from the Akash Supercloud, including NVIDIA H100, A100, and more, have been added to the Prime Intellect platform.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/prime-akash-header.Bm8o8RXL.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/prime-intellect-integrates-permissionless-akash-gpus/prime-akash-header.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;decentralized-ai-model-training-on-akash-with-flockio/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;decentralized-ai-model-training-on-akash-with-flockio&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nby [Zach Horn](https://x.com/zacharyhorn/) and [Matt Burke](https://linkedin.com/in/mattburkej/)\\n\\nDeveloping truly open and decentralized AI is one of society's most critical challenges. The networks, platforms, and clients we build will help guide this development, from open compute networks like Akash to platforms like FLock.io that make it easy to train and fine-tune AI models. Integrating these projects simplifies the user experience, enabling greater access that puts AI development directly in the hands of people around the world.\\n\\nThis case study outlines the integration between Akash and [FLock.io](https://www.flock.io/#/) that enables users to easily train AI models on decentralized compute. It illustrates how Akash, the first open-source Supercloud, gives AI developers access to the high-performance compute resources needed to train AI models with FLock.io, a platform for decentralized machine learning.\\n\\n- Section 1: An introduction to FLock.io\\n- Section 2: The decentralized AI training pipeline\\n- Section 3: The integration between Akash and FLock.io\\n- Section 4: A step-by-step guide for running FLock.io nodes on Akash\\n\\n## An Introduction to FLock.io\\n\\nFLock\u2019s mission is to democratize AI through decentralized, blockchain-based systems. FLock facilitates an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models, data, and computing resources, in exchange for on-chain rewards based on their traceable contributions.\\n\\nFLock is a platform focused on federated machine learning. Federated learning is a distributed approach to training AI models where the data remains decentralized, allowing for privacy-preserving and collaborative learning. FLock aims to empower businesses and developers to harness the power of federated learning by providing a secure and scalable infrastructure. By enabling the training of models on distributed data without the need for centralized storage, FLock helps address data privacy concerns while still leveraging collective insights from multiple sources. The platform offers a range of tools and APIs to facilitate the development, deployment, and monitoring of federated learning models, making it easier for organizations to adopt this innovative technology. With FLock, companies can unlock the potential of collaborative learning while ensuring data security and compliance with privacy regulations.\\n\\nThe team recently launched [train.FLock](https://train.flock.io/), FLock\u2019s flagship decentralized AI training platform deployed on Base Sepolia, marking a major milestone on the path to making the FLock mission a reality.\\n\\nAI Arena, a pillar product on the train.flock.io platform, is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)-like competition wherein AI &amp; ML engineers compete to finetune the best models for a given dataset. Participants stake FML, FLock.io\u2019s testnet token, and are rewarded based on the quality of their contributions. AI Arena has 4 participant types:\\n\\n- Task Creators: Define desired models and submit tasks to the platform\\n- Training Nodes: Develop or finetune models required by task creators\\n- Validators: Evaluate the models submitted by training nodes\\n- Delegators: Delegate tokens to validators, increasing reward distribution\\n\\n## The Decentralized AI Training Pipeline\\n\\nAn AI model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process, designed to make predictions or decisions based on input data. It is the output of training a machine learning algorithm on a dataset, resulting in a set of parameters and rules that can be used to map new input data to the desired output.\\n\\nAI model training is built around three foundational components: data, algorithms, and compute resources. Data provides the examples and patterns that the AI model learns from to make accurate predictions or decisions. Algorithms define the mathematical models and learning processes that enable the AI system to extract insights and knowledge from the data. Compute resources provide the computational power and infrastructure required to process large amounts of data, execute complex algorithms, and train sophisticated AI models efficiently.\\n\\nOnce a model is initially trained, there are two approaches for updating or improving it: bring the data to the model, or bring the model to the data. The former is often referred to as traditional machine learning, the latter as federated machine learning (or simply \u2018federated learning\u2019). In traditional machine learning, data is collected and centralized in a single location, where models are trained using the available compute resources, typically owned or controlled by a single entity. In contrast, federated learning enables models to be trained on distributed data across multiple devices or nodes, without the need to centralize the data. Federated learning allows for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, whereas traditional machine learning requires data to be shared and processed in a central location.\\n\\nAlthough these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, the heuristic is helpful when discussing AI training pipelines and how they differ in centralized and decentralized contexts.\\n\\nFLock\u2019s core user base (Task Creators, Training Nodes, and Validators) - reflect, at a high level, the AI training pipeline. Some training tasks are defined based on a base model and dataset (task creation). The model is improved based on new data and/or parameter tuning (training), and then its performance is measured by some score (e.g., loss), and this score is validated on a subset of data that the model hasn\u2019t seen before (validation) in order to update the model. The implementation details vary widely depending on the approach (traditional machine learning vs federated learning) and whether pipeline tasks take place in a centralized or decentralized context.\\n\\nGiven the overlap, separating what we mean by centralized and decentralized AI model training is important. The key questions to ask are:\\n\\n- Who controls task definition?\\n- Who owns the data used for task definition? What are the processes by which the data is collected? To what extent is the data public or private?\\n- Who owns the compute resources used for training and validation? Who controls access to these compute resources?\\n- How transparent are the inner workings of the model (e.g. parameters and algorithms)?\\n- Which aspects of the training pipeline are open-source and accessible to the public?\\n- To what extent can users update the model for their own domain-specific use cases?\\n- Who governs the model, and who governs the AI training process?\\n\\nIndeed, the reason Big Tech firms like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and NVIDIA dominate the AI space is because they\u2019ve vertically integrated the AI training stack. Such a centralized AI training process has clear advantages, including more granular control over the training pipeline. However, this approach is fraught with risks and ethical concerns. Decentralized AI training, especially based on blockchain tech, offers a better path forward but is not without its own set of challenges.\\n\\nThe UX for decentralized AI model training has room for improvement. The experience is disjointed and requires significant technical expertise that spans machine learning, blockchain interoperability knowledge, and network engineering. Even top-skilled machine learning engineers with Web2 backgrounds struggle to take advantage of capabilities unlocked with a decentralized AI training approach due to high barriers to entry.\\n\\nThese are the precise barriers to entry that Akash and FLock.io aim to break down.\\n\\n## Birds of a Feather: Akash &amp; FLock.io\\n\\nAs the adage goes, \u201cbirds of a feather flock together.\u201d As the decentralized AI movement takes flight, Akash and FLock.io are flying in unison. Akash is an open network that lets users buy and sell computing resources securely and efficiently. FLock.io is an open network that lets users train, validate, and govern AI models democratically and transparently.\\n\\nAkash is purpose-built for public utility. Compute is available to anyone on the network through Akash\u2019s peer-to-peer marketplace, and the network does not limit the types of tasks or workloads that can be deployed. Similarly, FLock.io is built for and by the community, and the platform does not restrict where models are trained, validated, hosted, and/or deployed.\\n\\nWith a clear alignment on visions for the future and shared values of openness, permissionlessness, and composability, it\u2019s clear to see why Akash and FLock.io are closely aligned.\\n\\nAs the first open-source Supercloud, Akash enables users to permissionlessly access cloud resources \u2014 including high-performance NVIDIA H100s, A100s, A6000s, 4090s, and many more. This is a massive unlock as it gives AI developers access to state-of-the-art GPUs to perform training and validation at affordable prices. Not only that, the Akash Console provides a user-friendly interface that abstracts away the complexity of compute resource management \u2013 a key friction point in the AI training pipeline \u2013 that allows AI developers to spend more time and energy focusing on what they are best at.\\n\\nThis is why, as we\u2019ll see in the following sections, FLock.io has integrated with Akash to create 1-click templates that make it easy to run FLock.io nodes on the Akash Supercloud.\\n\\nDid you know that Jiahao Sun, FLock.io\u2019s Founder &amp; CEO, presented at [Akash Accelerate \u201824](https://akash.network/blog/akash-accelerate-24-the-path-forward-for-permissionless-compute/)?

Hundreds of the brightest minds in the decentralized compute space gathered in Austin, TX to connect, share ideas, and explore the potential of decentralized compute and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) to address the most pressing problems facing our society today.\\n\\nThe presentations and panels focused on critical areas of development for DePIN and Decentralized AI.\\n\\n## The State of Akash Network\\n![The Akash Ecosystem](./akash-ecosystem.png)\\n\\nThe Akash ecosystem has seen remarkable growth over the past few years, attracting a wide range of companies, projects, and protocols. These entities are drawn to Akash's Supercloud, which offers high-performance compute, scalability, and permissionless access \u2014 features that set decentralized networks like Akash apart from centralized counterparts.\\n\\nFrom leading institutions like the University of Texas at Austin to AI companies like [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/), [Brev.dev](https://brev.dev/), and [Morpheus](https://mor.org/), the Akash ecosystem is rapidly expanding to include a wide range of participants who recognize the potential of truly decentralized infrastructure networks.\\n\\nThe University of Texas at Austin, known for its cutting-edge research in computer science and AI, is looking to the Akash Supercloud to support researchers in need of high-performance GPUs. By leveraging Akash's decentralized infrastructure, researchers have access to powerful GPUs without the constraints and costs associated with traditional hyperscale cloud providers, enabling them to pursue new areas of research that have previously been out of reach due to the massive costs of centralized compute.\\n\\nSimilarly, leading AI companies such as Nous Research, Brev.dev, and Morpheus leverage Akash to power their growth. These companies and protocols are at the forefront of AI development, developing applications and networks that not only benefit from but require permissionless access to compute. The Akash Supercloud provides them with the scalability and flexibility they need to train and fine-tune LLMs, process large datasets, and offer their users permissionless access to compute.\\n\\nBeyond the benefits of lower costs and scalability, Akash's permissionless access model is a significant draw for many projects in the ecosystem. Unlike centralized cloud providers that impose strict control over their platforms, Akash enables developers to deploy and run applications without seeking access permissions or adhering to restrictive policies. This opens up new possibilities, enabling startups and established companies to experiment with novel ideas and quickly bring their products to market.\\n\\nAs the demand for cloud computing continues to soar and the limitations of centralized providers become increasingly apparent, Akash's decentralized Supercloud is emerging and solidifying its position as a compelling alternative. The growing ecosystem of projects, protocols, and companies building on Akash is a testament to the platform's potential to reshape the future of cloud compute. With its high-performance compute, scalability, and permissionless access, Akash is poised to become the backbone of a new era of decentralized AI.\\n\\nListen to Greg Osuri\u2019s [keynote presentation](https://youtu.be/fVYeAVvuNLI?si=qfcMhCIxIwAjUPQc&t=20) at Akash Accelerate to learn about the new roadmap for Akash over the next few years and beyond.\\n\\n## The Power of Permissionless\\nAkash is built with self-sovereignty at its heart. The network is composed to afford significant flexibility and scalability, allowing users to provide and access compute resources with very little top-down control or censorship. This open architecture lays a foundation for a wide range of application types that rely on a fundamentally permissionless infrastructure layer. This dynamic is most prominent in the attention captured by the concept of \u201cPermissionless AI.\u201d\\n\\nPermissionless AI refers to the development and deployment of AI models and applications without the need for centralized control or approval. It enables individuals and organizations to freely create, train, and share AI models, reducing the barrier to entry and promoting open collaboration. By eliminating the requirement to secure permission from a central authority, permissionless AI democratizes access to powerful AI tools and encourages experimentation.\\n\\nIn Akash Accelerate\u2019s most anticipated conversation, [Greg Osuri](https://x.com/gregosuri) and [Erik Voorhees](https://x.com/ErikVoorhees) discussed how decentralized, permissionless systems can reduce the risk of overreliance on the goodwill of centralized companies.\\n\\n![Erik Voorhees and Greg Osuri in conversation](./erik-voorhees-and-greg-osuri.png)\\nThe debate between open-source and closed-source AI models has taken center stage, with open-source models like Llama 3 demonstrating capabilities on par with their closed-source counterparts. While the availability of high-quality open-source models is encouraging, there is a significant risk if large tech companies stop open-sourcing powerful models in the future.\\n\\nTo mitigate this risk, the decentralized community must find ways to train models independently. This could involve fostering a decentralized network of contributors, exploring alternative training methods, and advocating for the continued open-sourcing of powerful models by engaging with large tech companies.\\n\\nThe decentralized community should collaborate and pool resources to create a resilient ecosystem that is not reliant on a few large players. By exploring efficient algorithms, transfer learning techniques and novel architectures, the community can develop models with comparable performance using less data and computational power.\\n\\nBuilding strong partnerships and demonstrating the value of open-source contributions can encourage large tech companies to maintain their commitment to open-source AI. The future of AI depends on the decentralized community's ability to work together and find solutions to ensure the long-term sustainability and accessibility of the value that will be created by AI models and systems over the next decade and beyond.\\n\\n### Decentralized AI\\nDecentralized AI seeks to build the core infrastructure needed to train, fine-tune, and run inference on AI models while avoiding centralization and top-down control that come with closed-source systems and companies. By utilizing permissionless and scalable infrastructure, AI developers can train and deploy models in a distributed manner, protecting data privacy and reducing dependence on centralized cloud providers. This allows for greater collaboration and resource sharing and the ability to create novel AI applications that may not be possible within the confines of centralized systems.\\n\\nOne critical advantage of decentralized AI is the increased security and resilience it provides. Distributing data and computational resources across a network of nodes dramatically reduces the risk of a single point of failure. Cryptographic techniques also ensure that data remains private and secure, even when shared among multiple parties.\\n\\nAs AI evolves, decentralized approaches will likely play an increasingly important role in shaping its future development and applications.\\n\\nIn the \\&quot;Decentralized AI Revealed\\&quot; panel with David Johnston (OSS Contributor to Morpheus), Teana Baker Taylor (COO, Venice AI), Sam Padilla (Co-founder and head of product at Eidon AI), Cameron Fairchild (Software developer at Bittensor) \u2014 the panelists discussed how Decentralized AI enables new kinds of applications that are unique to decentralized networks. They explored how decentralized AI enhances privacy, security, and collaboration among network participants, allowing for the development of new and novel applications.\\n\\nThe panelists also discussed the potential for decentralized AI to make powerful AI tools and resources more widely available, enabling open access for developers and organizations. By leveraging decentralized networks, the future of AI is poised to become more open and transparent \u2014 bringing open AI development to a global scale.\\n\\n## How Decentralized Networks Can Enable Privacy-Preserving Learning\\n[Sriram Vishwanath](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/sriram-vishwanath), a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, presented a vision for how decentralized networks like Akash can unlock a unique path forward\u2014especially for [6G networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6G) and healthcare. In Professor Vishwanath\u2019s view, \u201cDecentralized AI is not just essential; it is critical.\u201d \\n\\nThere are two primary algorithms for decentralized AI. The first is Fully Distributed Learning, and the second is Federated Learning. Both of these are only possible with decentralized networks like Akash. As these networks evolve, four key areas give decentralized systems an advantage over centralized systems:\\n1. Privacy: Keeping data on edge servers, which is naturally privacy-preserving.\\n2. Bandwidth Conservation: Only model parameter updates are transferred, as opposed to the data itself, which is vastly more efficient.\\n3. Locality: Models are local and tuned to local variations.\\n4. Latency: Improvements in model inference and management as opposed to centralized systems.\\n\\nIn healthcare, privacy is a key concern that drives much of the decision-making for healthcare providers. Locality is also critical to healthcare providers, as patient data is inherently hyper-local. Patients in different parts of the world have vastly different characteristics and profiles. AI applications in healthcare must pull data from specific localities, which is a challenge best addressed by decentralized networks, given their distributed nature.\\n\\n6G networks are another area that will significantly benefit from decentralized systems. Building the infrastructure to support 6G networks is happening now, and tens of billions will be spent each year on 6G. Edge AI and Federated AI are the most promising architectures to support the development of robust 6G networks. Crucially, these are architectures only possible with decentralized systems, and it is doubtful that centralized AI could support the development of 6G networks at scale. These decentralized models could predict congestion points, where applications must be served (provisioning and tracking), and network security.\\n\\n## Building with the Supercloud: The Akash Builder Showcase\\n\\n### Passage\\n[Passage](https://www.passage.io/) is a platform that empowers creators to build immersive virtual worlds, fostering solid connections between creators and their communities.

Ollama is one of the early solutions that gained a significant amount of popularity among developers and has helped many developers accelerate their AI application development using open source AI models. A more recent solution is vLLM - that aims to overcome some of the limitations of Ollama. This post delves into what vLLM is and when and why developers should consider using it. Lastly, it also demonstrates how you can run vLLM easily on Akash Network.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\&quot;100%\\&quot; height=\\&quot;315\\&quot; src=\\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hv9681CV0Y?si=-h_-HgfcWC-_JoPD\\&quot; title=\\&quot;YouTube video player\\&quot; frameborder=\\&quot;0\\&quot; allow=\\&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\&quot; referrerpolicy=\\&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\&quot; allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Delving into vLLM\\n\\nvLLM is an LLM server implementation first introduced in a paper last year. Its primary objective was to make LLM inference faster for multiuser services. What vLLM does also achieve is overcoming some of the limitations of Ollama. vLLM enables you to serve more than 1 user at a time, natively, without having to proxy user requests between multiple GPUs. It also allows has somewhere between 2-4X the throughput of Ollama for concurrent requests.\\n\\nThe main change vLLM makes is adding Paged Attention to an LLM model by swapping out all the transformer attention modules for Paged Attention which implements attention more efficiently. The authors of vLLM describe Page Attention as, \u201cPaged Attention\u2019s memory sharing greatly reduces the memory overhead of complex sampling algorithms, such as parallel sampling and beam search, cutting their memory usage by up to 55%. This can translate into up to 2.2x improvement in throughput\u201d. You can read more about the technical details of paged attention in the [offical vLLM blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html). The current server implementation has gone beyond just Paged Attention and will soon support speculative encoding approaches. Other open source alternatives to vLLM include HuggingFace\u2019s TGI and the sglang engine with its Radix Attention implementation. The only drawback to using vLLM is that it doesn\u2019t support all of the super low quantization methods and file formats such as GGUF. If you haven\u2019t used GGUF before in llama.cpp-based tools like ollama then you should note that most people actively try to avoid using models with quantization lower than the 4bit (Q4) quantization due to performance issues. The good news is that most models are available in GPTQ or AWQ quantization formats that are supported by vLLM.\\n\\n![Benchmarks](./imgs/benchmarks.png)\\n\\nAt the time of the original paper (June 2023), vLLM dramatically outperformed TGI. Since then other 3rd parties have also found vLLM to be one of the most performant open source LLM server implementations available for concurrent requests. Again, one thing to note is that no one is putting Ollama or llama.cpp based implementations onto these benchmarks because those LLM servers are really intended to only support one user at a time and they are not suitable for being used as a service.\\n\\n![Compare](./imgs/compare.png)\\n\\n### Learn more about vLLM\\n\\n- [vLLM Docs](https://docs.vLLM.ai)\\n- [vLLM repo](https://github.com/vLLM-project/vLLM)\\n- [In-depth comparison study](https://pages.run.ai/hubfs/PDFs/Serving-Large-Language-Models-Run-ai-Benchmarking-Study.pdf)\\n\\n## Preparation\\n\\n1. Create an Akash account and ensure you have AKT tokens.\\n2. Login to console.akash.network with your wallet to launch an instance with an SDL (YAML) found in vLLM folder of the [Awesome-Akash repository](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/vllm)\\n\\n## Containerization\\n\\nWe are going to use the latest official vLLM container image: `vLLM/vLLM-openai:v0.4.0.post1`\\n\\nYou can also build your own image using the Dockerfile in the root of the vLLM repo.\\n\\nNote: you should never use latest as a tag for your containers in Akash SDL and that if you have a new model you should check if it has official vLLM support and note the date to make sure the container has been pushed since support has been added.\\n\\n## Deployment\\n\\n1. **Create a Deployment Configuration**: Create a YAML file for your vLLM deployment, including Docker configurations, resource requirements, and port exposures. See the example below which you should be able to copy and paste into Akash Console.\\n2. **Deploy**: Use Akash Console to deploy your application, which matches you with a suitable provider based on your deployment specifications.\\n3. **Use LLM UI**: After deployment, utilize the Akash Console field to find the IP address of the service and you should be good to go.\\n4. **Use LLM API**: After deployment, utilize the Akash Console field to find the IP address of the vLLM service and add the URI and API key variables to whichever client you are using (e.g. \\&quot;http://localhost:8000/v1\\&quot;).\\n\\nYou can find an example of using CrewAI in the `vLLM_crew_notebook_deployment.yml`.\\n\\nBelow is a code snippet using the LLM with Langchain in Python. Tool calling should be supported pretty well by any model that is as performant as WizardLM2-7B or better.\\n\\n`python\\nimport os\\nos.environ[\\&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY\\&quot;]=\\&quot;MYPASSWORD\\&quot;\\n#if inside akash service\\nos.environ[\\&quot;OPENAI_API_BASE\\&quot;]=\\&quot;http://vLLM:8000/v1\\&quot;\\n#if outside akash service update as needed based on provider, the port will change for every new deployment\\nos.environ[\\&quot;OPENAI_API_BASE\\&quot;]=\\&quot;https://provider.hurricane.akash.pub:31816/v1\\&quot;\\n#update for your model name\\nos.environ[\\&quot;OPENAI_MODEL_NAME\\&quot;] = \\&quot;MaziyarPanahi/WizardLM-2-7B-AWQ\\&quot;\\n\\nfrom langchain_community.llms import vLLMOpenAI\\nllm = vLLMOpenAI(\\n    openai_api_key=\\&quot;MYPASSWORD\\&quot;,\\n    openai_api_base=\\&quot;http://vLLM:8000/v1\\&quot;,\\n    model_name=\\&quot;MaziyarPanahi/WizardLM-2-7B-AWQ\\&quot;,\\n)\\nor\\nprint(llm.invoke(\\&quot;Rome is\\&quot;))\\n\\n`\\n\\nThe vLLM server is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI API, allowing you to use it as a drop-in replacement for applications using the OpenAI API.\\n\\nThis repository contains 4 example vLLM YAMLs, one example without a user interface and 3 with the OpenWebUI tool:\\n\\n- vLLM*no_ui_deployment.yml a basic example without a user interface\\n- vLLM_with_openwebui_dolphin2-9-llama3-70b.yml\\n- vLLM_with_openwebui_wizardlm2-7b.yml\\n- vLLM_with_openwebui_wizardlm2-8x22.yml\\n- vLLM_crew_notebook_deployment.yml\\n\\nThe vLLM server supports the following OpenAI API endpoints:\\n\\n- List models\\n- Create chat completion\\n- Create completion\\n\\n## Sizing vLLM for a number of different users\\n\\nSizing LLM Server resources for a particular application can be challenging because of the impact of model choice, quantization of that model, GPU hardware, and usage pattern ( human being vs agent). Anyscale ( the company behind Ray) has released a great LLM benchmarking tool called llmperf that is worth using for benchmarking your use case with your specific application requirements. Aside from using this tool, it has been reported that a single Nvidia A100 GPU can support between 10-20 concurrent users for 7B parameter Mistral model with AWQ on vLLM with lower throughput for other server options. Larger models will have lower throughput. There are also a lot of performance improvements going from 1 to 2 GPUs in a vLLM server, but this effect diminishes rapidly.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf you don't see the model in the OpenWebUI dropdown it usually means you chose a model that was too large for GPU, too large for disk space, or has a bad Hugginface repo entered into the deployment. You can usually verify which issue is from the logs. You will usually have to redeploy the deployment to change these parameters.\\n\\nSteps to Troubleshoot\\n\\n1. Read the logs for the vLLM container and the UI container\\n2. Check that the model weights are downloading correctly and can be loaded into VRAM\\n3. Check the model size is smaller than VRAM and container disk space\\n4. Check the Hugginface model repo to make sure the repo and author are correct\\n5. Check the Hugginface repo model type and make sure its not GGUF and is compatible with vLLM (GPTQ, AWQ, GGML, Safetensors etc)\\n6. Make sure that the model is [officially supported by vLLM](https://docs.vLLM.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)\\n7. Check the environment variables for setting the `vLLM_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEYS` environment variables match\\n8. Check that the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` is set for downloading models\\n9. if using the API externally make sure you have updated the url to use the deployer endpoint variable which can be done by setting `OPENAI_API_BASE`\\n10. if you have checked all of these and still have problems than open a issue in the awesome-akash repo and tag @rakataprime. In the issue, please provide your logs and deployment used with the Hugginface token and other secrets set to XXXXXXXXXXXX.\\n\\n## Choosing The Right GPU for An LLM Model\\n\\n- vLLM supported files formats include : GPTQ, AWQ, GGML(squeezelm ), and pytorch pth/bin and safetensors files\\n- vLLM DOES NOT SUPPORT GGUF files\\n- Check to make sure the base foundation model is supported [here](https://docs.vLLM.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)\\n- Make sure that the file size is smaller than the VRAM of the GPU with a little buffer room. Try to make sure the model files fit within 90% of the Total VRAM.\\n- Make sure the vLLM container has a large of disk space to store the model weights.\\n- If you are doing something funny with really large context lengths you can use the tools below to help estimate VRAM utilization.\\n- Remember that really large models like Grok sometimes require multiple gpus. the max number of gpus supported by this vLLM example is 8 gpus or 640Gb VRAM for a100\\n- If you needed more than 8 gpus you can use a larger ray cluster instead, but this is beyond the scope of this example. you can contact logan@thumper.ai for assistance if you need help with this.\\n\\n### Tools for Checking Model VRAM requirements\\n\\n- [\\&quot;Can-it-run\\&quot; - HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vokturz/can-it-run-llm)\\n- [\\&quot;LLM-Model-VRAM-Calculator\\&quot; - HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NyxKrage/LLM-Model-VRAM-Calculator)\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nvLLM may be one of the best open source LLM servers available today,for most applications with multiple users. We hope this blog makes it easier for people to use vLLM in their applications on Akash.

In particular, centralized cloud providers have permissioned servicing, limited resource availability, data lock-ins, and prohibitive costs that can be solved through decentralized computing.\\n\\nThe Akash Network is a decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources that solves the aforementioned issues plaguing the Web2 computing space. This is already seeing market share captured, but we believe that the transition is in its infancy stages and will only accelerate.\\n\\nIn this article, we will cover:\\n- The 4 issues of Web2 cloud computing\\n- The advantages of the Akash Network\\n- Key barriers to growth\\n\\nBy the end, it will become clear that decentralized computing is poised to gain significant market share from Web2 cloud computing and is an area of blockchain technology worth carefully monitoring.\\n\\n## Web2 Cloud Computing\\n\\nPublic cloud end-user spending is estimated to reach $679B in 2024, making it one of the largest industries in existence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone generated $91B in 2023, and both the increasingly digitized world and the rise of A.I. mean that this space is only likely to continue growing.\\n\\nNearly every company uses cloud services in one way or another, including for:\\n- Data computing\\n- Data storage\\n- Databases\\n- A.I. and Machine Learning\\n- Internet of Things (IoT)\\n- Developer tooling\\n\\nAnd much more.\\n\\nThat being said there are 4 critical issues at present:\\n\\n1. **Permissioned Servicing**: Any change to a cloud provider\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions can lead to an exclusion of users or validators. For example, Hetzner, Ethereum\u2019s 2nd biggest host, laid down rules against crypto operations.\\n2. **Resource Availability**: Cloud providers may restrict access for more niche or rare computing resources. For example, Nvidia\u2019s H100s, cutting-edge GPUs for A.I. training, often require reserve instances, whereby one must commit to paying upfront and for a minimum period of time. Customers below a monthly spending threshold, or without a longstanding relationship with their provider, may be unable to access these specialized resources at all.\\n3. **Data Lock-Ins**: Service providers prefer to lock customers into their ecosystems, making it either challenging, costly, or outright impossible to integrate with external cloud providers. Furthermore, the cost to actually export/import large amounts of data between providers, known as ingress/egress costs, is substantial.\\n4. **Prohibitive Costs**: SaaS companies expend ~50% of their revenue on cloud computing services, significantly hindering their profitability. These costs also extend to blockchain, restricting the number of potential validators and in turn limiting decentralization.\\n\\nDespite Web2 computing being good \u201cenough\u201d, its Web3 counterpart is gaining fast traction and chipping away at market share. Below we\u2019ll cover how the Akash Network\u2019s decentralized computing alternative has several key advantages that strongly position it for increased adoption, and make it a must-know for those both inside and outside of the space.\\n\\n## The Advantages of Akash Network\\n\\nThe Akash Network is a decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources, that can be thought of as an Airbnb-of-sorts.\\n\\nBy connecting parties with excess resources (\u201cProviders\u201d) with those seeking these resources (\u201cTenants\u201d), these Providers can earn a new source of revenue while Consumers also benefit. Bids are automatically matched with offers, and the network\u2019s AKT token is used for purposes such as staking, governance, transactions, and proper incentivization.\\n\\n![akash-marketplace](./akash-marketplace.png)\\n\\nThis is significant, as global data centers vastly utilize their computing resources, and those in demand of resources may face various challenges when interacting with centralized firms (which we\u2019ll cover below).\\n\\nWith Akash, any cloud-native application can be deployed without the need to write in a new language, nor be subject to restrictions such as vendor lock-ins. Pricing is discovered through reverse auctions, and those that deploy applications onto Akash set the price and terms of their deployment that are accepted when a winning bid is chosen.\\n\\nThere are significant advantages to this model:\\n\\n- **Permissionless**: The primary advantage is that anyone may access computing resources. At present, ~65% of Ethereum nodes use AWS, OVH, Google, or Hetzner, which can be concerning if any parties arbitrarily change their policies and conditions. For example, in 2022, Hetzner introduced anti-crypto policies.\\n- **Resource Availability**: Given the open-source nature of Akash, any type of computing resource, in any geography, can be shared. This contrasts with centralized providers who may not have all computing resources, nor support all geographies.\\n- **Cost**: Prices are up to 85% lower on the Akash network compared to centralized entities.\\n- **No Data Lock-ins**: Users can mix and match who they lease resources from and take their data with them as they wish.\\n\\nConsidering that large enterprise companies spend up to 50% of their revenue on public cloud hosting, the Akash Network\u2019s cost-factor alone is enough to warrant serious reconsideration over one\u2019s cloud provider. However, combined with its permissionless nature, extensive resource availability, and no data lock-ins, we believe that it\u2019s a seriously improved business model that will continue to gain fast traction.\\n\\n## Obstacles to Decentralized Computing Adoption\\n\\nDespite the above, there remain barriers to adoption that are hindering widespread adoption and can be summarized as below:\\n- **Poor User Experience**: Web3\u2019s user experience still lags behind Web2\u2019s. It is currently hard for the average person to open a Cosmos-supported wallet such as Keplr or Leap, purchase $AKT tokens, and begin using the Akash Network.\\n- **Integration Challenges**: Web2\u2019s computing industry is quite mature, and many once-challenging integrations are now simple to handle, while that is not the case for Web3 integrations. For example, certain niche workplace CRMs may have trouble integrating with the Akash Network.\\n- **Lack of Web3 Developers**: The number of active developers remains very low compared to Web2. There are currently an estimated 23.3K Web3 developers, compared to 28M Web2 developers (0.007%).\\n- **Lack of Awareness**: Many remain skeptical of blockchain technology and unaware of decentralized computing. Despite increases occurring in bull markets, it is an emerging technology that will take time to spread.\\n\\nAll of the above are also challenges that were faced and overcome by the internet. We believe that the same will occur with Web3, albeit at a faster pace. Decentralized computing is undoubtedly a superior technology in the defined set of ways that were covered in this article, but transitions at such a grand scale naturally take time.\\n\\nThat being said, adoption is accelerating. Akash has now reached 71 active providers and 160 active leases. The main priority has been increasing supply through the onboarding of new providers, and this has been increasing steadily.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn the above article, we explained the advantages of decentralized cloud computing over Web2 cloud computing.\\n\\nWe believe that the advantages are significant and represent a naturally superior solution, but that true change takes time and that barriers exist. As the industry matures and more enter the space, this will help to accelerate adoption, and the Akash Network will be leading the way. \\n\\nTo learn more and get started with the network, visit [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) and follow Akash on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/akashnet*).\\n\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Rise of Decentralized Compute&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Explore the issues in Web2 cloud computing, discover Akash Network's decentralized solution, and learn about adoption barriers in the evolving tech space.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2024-04-10T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Community&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Community&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Lachlan Todd&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/akash-decentralized-compute.BveTjvlr.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/the-rise-of-decentralized-compute/akash-decentralized-compute.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;foundation-ai-model-training-on-akash/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;foundation-ai-model-training-on-akash&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n[Anil Murty](https://twitter.com/_Anil_Murty_) &amp; [Logan Cerkovnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logancerkovnik/)\\n\\nTowards the end of 2023, Overclock Labs (core team behind Akash Network) and ThumperAI (generative AI startup) decided to embark on a mission to train a foundation model on Akash GPUs. This post delves into the why and how of the training exercise and also talks about the outcomes and next steps.\\n\\n## Why Train a Foundation Model?\\n\\nGenerative AI Foundation model training is one of the most important and challenging jobs for cloud compute platforms due to the cost, hardware requirements and software complexity. Most decentralized compute marketplaces today are unable to meet these requirements for AI startups and so we thought it would be a great way to set a high bar by attempting to do so on Akash Network.\\n\\nBesides the above common/overarching goal, the two teams (Overclock Labs and ThumperAI) had the following individual goals.\\n\\n## ThumperAI\u2019s Goals:\\n\\nThumperAI is building [Lora Trainer](https://loratrainer.com/) - a service that makes it easy for AI developers to use LoRA techniques to fine-tune foundation models. So, offering their own foundation model would add credibility to their mission. And success with this would potentially lead to them following up by running the LoraTrainer service on Akash as well (which currently runs on a centralized cloud provider).\\n\\n## Akash Network and Overclock Labs\u2019 Goals:\\n\\n- Demonstrating that AI model training can be conducted on Akash Network's decentralized cloud platform, thereby attracting AI and ML developers (web3 and web2) to Akash Network.\\n- Positioning GPU providers for success (by generating demand).\\n- Rounding out AI use cases, by adding model training (Inference and fine tuning had already been demonstrated).\\n- Strengthening Akash Networks\u2019 open source commitment by building and contributing an open source AI model to the broader OSS community.\\n- Contribute an Image generation AI Model to the broader open source community that can be used with less risk of copyright infringement.\\n- Demonstrating how to deploy and run Ray Clusters on Akash Network.\\n\\n## Decisions &amp; Tradeoffs\\n\\nAs with any significant project, we had to make a number of decisions and tradeoffs before we embarked on the mission. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the key ones.\\n\\n![Thumper Model Training](./model-training-flow.png)\\n\\n## Model Category Choice\\n\\nThere are obviously several categories of models that we could choose from (the category list from HuggingFace on the right here provides a good reference).\\n\\nThis was our thought process in arriving at a category:\\n\\n1. Arguably the two categories of models that have garnered most mainstream media attention are Large Language Models (or LLMs) and Image Generation Models. This is hugely attributable to the success of companies like OpenAI, StabilityAI and Midjourney to name a few.\\n2. Image generation models tend to be cheaper to train that large-language models because they are relatively often much smaller in terms of number of parameters, oftentime use convolutional layers instead of transformers throughout the model, and tend to train faster than llms.\\n3. There have been [several articles published](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit) about copyright infringement lawsuits made against image generation models that were trained on proprietary datasets like Getty Images. Having an AI model that did not have these limitations would be a great thing\\n\\nOn the 3rd point specifically, we thought it would be a good experiment to try to train an image generation model using a copyright free image data set like [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) and so that is what we decided to pursue.\\n\\n![HuggingFace Models](./huggingface-model-overview.png)\\n\\n## Base Model Choice\\n\\nOnce we decided on working with an Image generation model, the next decision was which specific model to work with. The 3 most popular ImageGen models at the time (arguably even now) were [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image), Midjourney and DALL-E. Stable Diffusion was an easy choice because it is [open source](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) while the others aren\u2019t, so initially that was what we had decided to go with and that was what was written in the [proposal](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/300) submitted to the Akash community for discussion. We chose to use Stable Diffusion 1.5 in order to meet budget constraints outlined in the proposal.\\n\\nAs we got closer to starting the actual training exercise, MosiacML [published a paper](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2310.16825) indicating that they were also looking at training Stable Diffusion with a creative commons data set, but were planning to use Stable Diffusion 2.0. Luckily we were able to find a new model called [Pixart-Alpha](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/) that had performance benchmarks very comparable to SDXL (the state of the art Stable Diffusion Model at the time). We ultimately ended up going with a slightly different Pixart-Alpha-inspired architecture proposed by [Alexandru Papiu](https://github.com/apapiu/transformer_latent_diffusion) after we had some training issues with the Pixart-Alpha Architecture.\\n\\n![Huang et al. 2023](./pixart-alpha-paper.png)\\n\\n## Dataset Choice\\n\\nWe created a Creative Commons licensed dataset by filtering [YFCC100M](https://registry.opendata.aws/multimedia-commons/) and [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) for images with CC0 or CC-SA licenses.\\n\\nThose datasets can be found at their huggingface pages here:\\n\\n- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion5B-index](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion5B-index)\\n- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/dalle-mini/YFCC100M_OpenAI_subset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dalle-mini/YFCC100M_OpenAI_subset)\\n\\nFor fine tuning we used a curated collection of 2M AI Generated images that were published under MS-PL license that were taken from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT)\\n\\nTo create our initial dataset, we used two of the largest dataset with Creative Commons License data included in them and filtered for images that had either CC0 or CC-SA creative commons licenses. These dataset were chosen for their size and inclusion of license metadata. We believe some of the challenges we have encountered with the model training is very likely due to the lower quality and diversity of this dataset. During the fine tuning portion of the model training we shifted to AI generated images licensed under the MS-PL license. It would appear that this dataset was insufficient to improve the models performance. For training purposes we always used cached text and vae embedding layers to improve the training efficiency. Captions were generated using the LLAVA 1.5 model.\\n\\n## Hardware Choice\\n\\nFor the actual training cluster, we used the following GPU cluster set up and managed by the [Europlots](https://console.akash.network/providers/akash18ga02jzaq8cw52anyhzkwta5wygufgu6zsz6xc) provider on Akash:\\n\\n- 32x A100 80GB (PCIe interconnect) GPUs\\n- 1024 vCPUs\\n- 4096GB of Memory,\\n- 32TB NVMe Storage\\n- 1920GB SSD\\n\\nWe also used 16 RTX8000 GPUs from the [FoundryStaking](https://console.akash.network/providers/akash17gqmzu0lnh2uclx9flm755arylrhgqy7udj3el?network) provider for the fine-tuning portion of training.\\n\\n## Software Stack\\n\\nWe used Ray Clusters to run distributed training across the 48 GPUs across two providers. If you are curious about Ray and how to use it to run distributed ML workloads across Akash GPUs, check out our [detailed blog post](https://akash.network/blog/distributed-machine-learning-on-akash-network-with-ray/) on the topic.\\n\\nThe architecture of the system we utilized for it can be described with the following blocks:\\n\\n![Training Architecture](./model-training-architecture.png)\\n\\n## Training\\n\\nThe end-to-end training pipeline can be summarized with the following block diagram:\\n\\n![Training Pipeline](./model-training-overview-2.png)\\n\\n## Outcomes\\n\\nHere are some images generated from the model:\\n\\n![Thumper Output](./thumper-6.png)\\n\\nThe model\u2019s performance on image generation is heavily influenced by the training dataset\u2019s bias towards paintings at the expense of photos. This is likely due to photos being released under creative commons licenses less frequently than other image content.\\n\\nWhile the image output from this first model is far from perfect, that has more to do with the data sets than the cloud and ability to run workloads on Akash. With that in mind, we feel pretty good about achieving the objectives we set out to achieve but here\u2019s a quick rundown of the goals we had hoped to achieve and how we think we did on them:\\n\\n## Goals\\n\\n1. Demonstrating that AI model training can be conducted on Akash Network's decentralized cloud platform, thereby attracting AI and ML developers (web3 and web2) to Akash Network.\\n2. Positioning GPU providers for success (by generating demand).\\n3. Rounding out AI use cases, by adding model training (Inference and fine tuning had already been demonstrated in the testnet and beyond).\\n4. Strengthening Akash Networks\u2019 open source commitment by building and contributing an open source AI model to the broader OSS community.\\n5. Contribute an Image generation AI Model to the broader open source community that can be used with less risk of copyright infringement.\\n6. Demonstrating how to deploy and run Ray Clusters on Akash Network.\\n\\n## Outcomes\\n\\n1. While the model output isn\u2019t as great as we had hoped it would be we showed that it is feasible to train foundation models on akash and identified areas to improve for the future including:\\n - Making it easier to increase shm for workloads,\\n - Improving benchmarking, and\\n - Using streaming dataloaders during training\\n2. We were able to work with two providers (Europlots and Foundystaking) and reliably use them for training - and that has enabled us to reference the work towards attracting several other teams building GenAI applications to utilize Akash compute.\\n3. Prior to this work, no one had trained a foundational model on Akash before. The foundation model training stack has different requirements from inference and fine-tuning. Knowledge learned from this will help inform future foundation model training on akash. The core team has already identified 2-3 other teams that will be training foundation models in the days and weeks to come.\\n4. The source code for conducting the model training is open-source: [https://github.com/thumper-ai/at1](https://github.com/thumper-ai/at1)\\n5. The training and inference code is available here: [https://huggingface.co/thumperai/akash-thumper-v1](https://huggingface.co/thumperai/akash-thumper-v1). We have released the model weights on HuggingFace as well: [https://huggingface.co/thumperai/akash-thumper-v1](https://huggingface.co/thumperai/akash-thumper-v1).\\n6. We have added SDLs for Ray Cluster\u2019s to the Awesome-Akash repo: [https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/ray](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/ray).\\n\\n## Learnings\\n\\n- Ray Jobs - Due to the inability to remount persistent volumes in Akash we had to keep the same ray cluster up for an extended period of time and could not rebuild the container for additional retraining or tweaks to the codebase. We also used the Ray dependency management to maintain several virtual environments for the different stages of training.\\n- Caching Latent Images - The most efficient way of training text to image models today is to train off of presaved latent images.\\n- Streaming Dataloaders - We went with ray datasets with a webdataset format. We found that the webdataset format was the best format for supporting saved numpy or torch tensors in a steam\\n- Logging - Used Ray Dashboard, Tensorboard logs, and Weights and Biases for logging training information. Weights and Biases is nice because its logs GPU temperature and additional hardware metrics that are not present in the ray dashboard. It\u2019ll be great to have some of these metrics be natively available in Akash provider dashboards.\\n- Storage - We used both Backblaze and akash minio deployments for s3-compatible object storage. The challenge with akash hosted minio deployments is that oftentimes the gpu providers lack sufficient additional disk space to function as long term storage provider for models logs and weights. The core team has since been working to add several providers with larger disk storage to the network.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations for using Ray on Akash:\\n\\n- **Getting Bids for a large GPU cluster:** Make sure the cluster generates bids in a small configuration with minimal gpu, cpu, and storage requirements. Make sure the gpu tag is right. Some providers will have different tags for a gpu model eg nvidia-a100 vs a100. After the small configuration generates bids you can increase resources gradually in the deployment until it reaches your requirements. The provider dashboard and script will sometimes overestimate the resources available due to resource fragmentation. Contact the Akash provider if they can help you tweak the resource profile if you are having trouble.\\n- **S3 compatible object storage:** You should consider which s3 compatible object storage service you may want to use. Syncing FSDP checkpoints during ray train jobs requires an s3 compatible storage service or a network file drive. You can use a self-hosted minio deployment or a 3rd party storage provider such as backblaze.\\n\\n- **Enabling SHM:** Ray Cluster\u2019s plasma object store is most performant when running in-memory and is often set to consume 20-30% of RAM. Docker containers and k8s pods default shm resources to ~2Mb which is too low for pytorch dataloaders and ray clusters during ML training jobs. For k8s platforms, an empty directory volume mount is needed to increase shm. Please coordinate with your provider on Discord before deploying so they can enable the increased shm setting. (link to provider guide to enabling SHM). Once shm is enabled you should see a larger object store in the ray cluster dashboard. If the deployment gets restarted you will need to have the provider\\n repeat the process. The core team has prioritized supporting setting SHM as part of their roadmap here: [https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/projects/5/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=50909379](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/projects/5/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=50909379)\\n\\nWe had some initial training issues with the model being patchy with the Pixart-Alpha architecture and shifted early on to the latent transformer architecture proposed by Alexandru Papiu. This makes some changes to Pixart to add a Convolutional layer to help the model learn spatial patterns easier. We also have experimented with perceptual loss [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00110) although we did not see a significant improvement with that either.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next\\n\\nThere are two potential next projects that the two teams will consider leveraging Akash Network for, based on the learnings from this AT-1 training exercise:\\n\\n- While the The AT-1 model training exercise was a great first step it is clear that the current performance is not good enough to be competitive with text-to-image models today. Further, while the goal was noble, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a viable path to improving the model on purely creative commons datasets at this point in time. Thumper has decided to pivot away from creative commons models and will consider training and releasing a model merge or further fine tuned version of AT-1 at a future date that would include non-creative commons data/models.\\n- The Thumper team will look into migrating [https://loratrainer.com/](https://loratrainer.com/) to run on Akash Network as they look to scale that service, so as to take advantage of the lower costs (relative to their current centralized provider) and variety of GPUs available on the network. One of the features needed before they can do this is the ability to [request a max SHM size](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/179) through the Akash SDL. That feature is about to be made available on the network through an upgrade.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Foundation AI Model Training on Akash&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Towards the end of 2023, Overclock Labs (core team behind Akash Network) and ThumperAI (generative AI startup) decided to embark on a mission to train a foundation model on Akash GPUs.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;Case Studies&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Anil Murty&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/foundation-ai-model-akash-6.Cg9MDYuS.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/foundation-ai-model-training-on-akash/foundation-ai-model-akash-6.png&quot;]}],&quot;archive&quot;:[0,false]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-at-ethdenver-2024/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-at-ethdenver-2024&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;The Akash Core Team heads to Denver to connect with builders in the decentralized and permissionless infrastructure space.\\n\\n*This post will be updated as new events are added.*\\n\\n## Attending\\n### Overclock Labs\\n- [Greg Osuri](https://twitter.com/gregosuri), CEO\\n- [Adam Wozney](https://twitter.com/AdamDeanWozney), Head of Community\\n- [Zach Horn](https://twitter.com/zacharyhorn), Head of Marketing\\n- [Maxime Beauchamp](https://twitter.com/thereisnomax), Founder of Cloudmos\\n- [Scott Hewitson](https://twitter.com/HeyHewi), Director of Finance\\n- Ty Wright, Head of Operations\\n\\n### Akash Insiders\\n- Zeke, Akash Insider\\n- [Thomas Greco](https://twitter.com/tgrecojs), Akash Insider\\n\\n## Connect with the Akash Core Team\\n### Tuesday, 2/27\\n**[Autonomous Agent: AI x Web3 Global Hackathon Kick-off](https://lu.ma/k6dw9jk2)**\\n- Zeke will be leading a workshop at 11AM MST\\n\\n**[Appchain Day](https://lu.ma/AppchainDay) presented by [Dorahacks](https://dorahacks.io/)**\\n- Akash will have a sponsored booth from 9AM-5PM MST\\n- Adam Wozney will be moderating a panel, \u201cIBC for Appchains\u201d at 3:30PM MST\\n\\n### Wednesday, 2/28\\n**[Decentralize AI Day](https://lu.ma/mxh1cf8u) presented by [Morpheus](https://mor.org/)**\\n- Greg Osuri and Zach Horn will be attending\\n- Greg will be presenting from 10:30-11AM MST\\n\\n**[ATOMDenver](https://lu.ma/atomdenver2)**\\n- Akash will be sponsoring \\n- Greg will be speaking on two panels\\n - 1:40-2:05PM MST: \u201cHow Crypto Benefits from AI\u201d alongside [Kerem Ozkan - Soarchain, Head of Ecosystem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremozkan/), [Lex Avellino- Passage, Founder and CCO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lex-avellino/), and [Jack Zampolin - Strangelove, CEO and Co-Founder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackzampolin/).\\n - 2:10-2:40PM MST: \u201cDePIN Updates\u201d alongside [Kerem Ozkan - Founder, Soarchain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremozkan/), and [Paul Bramas - KYVE, Head of Ecosystem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-bramas-2977b785/?originalSubdomain=de)\\n\\n### Thursday, 2/29\\n**Akash will have a sponsored booth in the Main Venue at the [National Western Complex](https://nationalwesterncomplex.com/)**\\n- From 2/29-3/3\\n- Section 14, Booth 246\\n- The entire Core Team will be spending time at the booth throughout the event.

As Passage scales its platform, which allows creators to build virtual worlds, it will utilize Akash compute to achieve three key objectives: Greatly reducing the costs of hosting Passage Worlds, unlocking the ability to scale with permissionless compute, and preserving sovereignty and privacy for creators.\\n\\nIn a world with many options for cloud resources, both centralized and decentralized, Akash makes achieving each of these objectives uniquely possible with the only fully open-source Supercloud.\\n\\n## Scaling with the Supercloud\\n\\nThe decision to leverage Akash Network to scale Passage completed the final piece of a long-term strategy. In building their platform, Passage aimed to balance quality, accessibility, and cost. Initially, the platform prioritized the first two \u2013 quality and accessibility. By choosing to focus on quality (using Unreal Engine 5) and accessibility (ensuring the platform works in any browser without downloads), Passage chose to utilize higher-cost AWS compute as the platform was under development.\\n\\nStarting today, Passage is tapping into Akash\u2019s scalability to manage these costs, with a reduction in hosting costs by 50%, and further savings up to 70% with additional optimizations.\\n\\nThe results from the first Passage Worlds hosted on Akash have resulted in compute savings up to 70% cheaper than AWS or Google Cloud with comparable hardware (high-density P100s and RTX 3090s).\\n\\n## Open-sourcing the Passage community\\n\\nDrawing inspiration from Akash\u2019s open community, which features a set of working groups that develop and grow the network, [Passage has launched an open-source initiative](https://www.passage.io/post/open-source) that will give the community access to become involved in every aspect of building Passage\u2019s platform.\\n\\nFrom the [Passage roadmap](https://www.passage.io/post/open-source):\\n\\n> Our proposed roadmap follows, but priorities and plans will ultimately be determined by the Steering Committee.\\n>\\n> - Core infrastructure improvements on the indexer\\n> - Improved sorting and searching\\n> - Community initiatives (Astro Pucks, Golden Pucks)\\n> - Complete NFT staking\\n> - Complete auctions &amp; offers front-end\\n> - Enable native USDC sales\\n\\nTo join the open community and start contributing, head to [passage.io](https://passage.io) to learn more.\\n\\n## Launching an AKT/PASG Pool on Osmosis\\n\\nAs a part of the official launch of Passage World utilizing Akash compute, Passage and Overclock Labs are launching a new AKT/PASG pool on Osmosis, backed by $200,000 in liquidity from both teams, and liquidity providers will be able to receive custom roles in the Passage Discord.\\n\\nThe AKT/PASG pool is [live on Osmosis now](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1498).\\n\\n## Learn more about Passage\\n\\nPassage is building an exciting new platform to power an entirely new way for creators to interact with their communities.

Because of its sheer size, it\u2019s slow, expensive, and resistant to change. Improving the core aspects of the industry \u2014 cost and access to care, patient data ownership, and the cost of administrative overhead \u2014 creates the best opportunity for real impact to change the lives of billions of patients around the world.\\n\\nToday, Akash Network and [Solve.Care](https://solve.care/), a blockchain-based healthcare relationship management platform that enables the creation and deployment of digital health networks, are partnering to provide an entirely new way for individuals and organizations to manage their patient healthcare data. By choosing Akash as their primary way to access permissionless compute resources, Solve.Care will be able to decentralize patient data, pioneering blockchain's integration into healthcare systems with improved security, transparency, and accessibility. This will enable organizations to reduce their administrative overhead without prior technical knowledge and allow patients to regain true ownership of their most important data.\\n\\n## Key Aspects of the Partnership\\n\\nSolve.Care is focusing on three primary areas of impact as it integrates permissionless Akash compute:\\n\\n**Ownership of patient data.** Due to current industry regulations, patient data is required to be kept on file for seven years, often in hyperscalers like Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud (GCP). Under this system, the patient doesn\u2019t have sovereignty over their data. On top of this, there is no digital permanence if data and backups are lost, as opposed to blockchain-based solutions which enable data to persist indefinitely.\\n\\n**Reducing administrative overhead for healthcare organizations.** The overhead to mail the required Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms to patients costs healthcare organizations hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Using a Solve.Care node, patients can access these EOB forms without needing paper copies to be sent in the mail \u2014 which could reduce administrative costs by an order of magnitude. In addition to the direct savings on EOBs, enterprises also benefit from the reduction in liability that comes with keeping patient data on file. With Care.Nodes running on low cost Akash compute, healthcare providers are able to directly lower their administrative overhead.\\n\\n**Demonstrate how blockchains can serve real-world use cases.** Blockchain uniquely enables data ownership to become decentralized in a way that was previously not possible. Reliance on massive centralized healthcare providers has become slow and inefficient. Using blockchain-based nodes to store healthcare data gives patients sovereignty over their medical records and data, empowering them to control who can and can\u2019t access their information.\\n\\n## How the technology behind Akash and Solve.Care\u2019s partnership will operate\\n\\nAkash enables access to the compute needed to deploy Solve.Care\u2019s proprietary node infrastructure (Care.Nodes) to patients worldwide. Because Akash is a distributed network with compute providers worldwide, Solve.Care can permissonlessly access compute in the regions where their enterprise clients and patients live and receive care.\\n\\nThis provides two key benefits:\\n\\n1. Enterprise care providers can reduce the liability of managing patient data by allowing that data to be stored in the patient\u2019s personal Care.Node \u2014 deployed in the region where the patient lives and receives care.\\n2. It significantly reduces the cost of delivering Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents. Today, printing and mailing these documents to patients can cost upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars. By delivering EOBs directly to patient Care.Nodes, enterprise healthcare providers can reduce their administrative costs by an order of magnitude.\\n\\n## The path forward for decentralized healthcare\\n\\nThis partnership between Akash Network and Solve.Care represents a transformative step forward in the way that healthcare data is managed and accessed. Using Akash\u2019s open network, Solve.Care will be able to directly address critical issues in the healthcare industry around data ownership, efficiency, and transparency. This partnership will enable the creation of Care.Nodes for patients around the world, which allow patient data control to become truly decentralized. It not only places patients in full control of their health data, but also optimizes the delivery of healthcare services by minimizing unnecessary administrative expenses.\\n\\nIn summary, the Akash Network and Solve.Care partnership marks a crucial development in making healthcare more patient-centric, secure, and cost-effective. This initiative sets a new benchmark for the integration of technology in healthcare, making the healthcare industry more open and accessible for all.\\n\\nTo stay informed of the latest developments in this partnership, follow [Akash](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) and [Solve.Care](https://twitter.com/Solve_Care) on X.

This includes not just inference but even fine-tuning a model to adapt it to custom data sets and application needs and in some cases, even training a foundation model. Open source libraries from [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and others have allowed those without extensive experience in AI and ML, to relatively easily build Python based applications that leverage advanced AI capabilities. The challenge then shifts to being able to horizontally scale workloads to take advantage of a large number of computers, so as to be able to accelerate time to market and/ or run a service in production and scale it in response to user demand.\\n\\nThis concept of taking an ML workload that is built to run on a single GPU (server) and enabling it to run on a number of GPU servers (referred to as a \u201ccluster\u201d) is what is called \u201cclustering\u201d and \u201cscaling\u201d. The challenge of course is that, in order to do this, the application that was built to run on a single server needs to be parallelized to run on multiple machines. Doing this \u201cnatively\u201d (by adding support for it directly in the application code) would require an advanced understanding of cloud infrastructure and parallel computing. This creates a technical barrier to being able to launch and scale such applications.\\n\\n## Ray to save the day!\\n\\n[Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) is an open source framework that enables software developers not trained in distributed systems to easily leverage distributed computing. It does this by removing the burden of needing to natively parallelize a machine learning application, while enabling computations to scale out across a cluster of servers. This allows AI and ML developers to easily scale out their application or workload across a cluster of servers, without having to write additional code for that or needing to understand the details of the underlying infrastructure.\\n\\nSome of the capabilities Ray offers include:\\n\\n- **Automatic scaling:** In theory at least, a ray cluster creates the virtual abstraction of a single computer across a distributed cluster that can be very large.\\n- **Fault Tolerance:** By automatically rerouting tasks to other machines, when one or more nodes fail, Ray enables resilience that is crucial for long running AI training workloads and/ or production scale inference.\\n- **State Management:** With built in support for sharing and coordinating data across tasks and flexibility to use a variety of storage options - including in-memory (redis or equivalent) as well as cloud storage (S3 equivalent).\\n\\n## Ray AI Runtime (AIR)\\n\\nRay\u2019s ultimate goal is to provide a simple programmatic interface for developers to leverage distributed computing, so that you don\u2019t have to be a distributed systems expert to be able to deploy, run, scale and manage your ML workload across a cluster of machines. The Ray AI Runtime (AIR) is the toolkit that implements this abstraction on top of the core Ray functionality.\\n\\n![Ray on Akash](./ray-diagram-1.png)\\n\\nThe libraries made available as part of the AIR toolkit enable organizations to run the full gamut of ML workloads on distributed computing platforms like Akash Network.\\n\\n- [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html): Framework-agnostic model serving library that can be used to build and deploy end-to-end distributed AI/ ML inference applications.\\n- [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html): Library for ML experiment execution and [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization).\\n- [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html): Scalable machine learning library for distributed training and fine-tuning.\\n\\n## Typical Ray Workflow\\n\\nThe typical Ray based machine learning workflow may involve the following steps:\\n\\n1. Build your AI/ML application (typically Python code)\\n2. Write a YAML file that will define your Ray cluster\\n3. Execute commands on the CLI to turn on/ off the cluster\\n4. Submit jobs and monitor them via the (web) dashboard\\n\\n![Ray on Akash](./ray-diagram-2.png)\\n\\n## Ray on Akash\\n\\nRay is fairly infrastructure agnostic and works with Docker containers - so it naturally lends itself to being a great solution to provide an abstraction of a \u201csingle server\u201d on the [Akash Network decentralized cloud](https://akash.network/blog/building-the-open-cloud-part-2-re-imagining-the-cloud-with-akash/#akash-network-under-the-hood).\\n\\nTo enable users of Akash Network to easily utilize Ray\u2019s capabilities, the ThumperAI team working with the Overclock Labs team has built a set of docker images and an [Akash SDL](https://akash.network/docs/getting-started/stack-definition-language/) (Stack Definition Language) template that can be used as a reference for anyone wanting to run Ray clusters on Akash. The source code for this can be found on the [\u201cawesome-akash](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash)\u201d repository (contains an ever growing set of reference templates for running various common applications on Akash) at the following location:\\n\\n[https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/ray](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/tree/master/ray)\\n\\nThe reference template is specifically optimized for GPU-based workloads and deploys a Ray cluster consisting of one [Head Node](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#head-node) and six [Worker Nodes](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#worker-node).\\n\\nYou can customize the reference to your specific workload needs in the following ways:\\n\\n1. To update the version of Ray, Python or CUDA, update the Dockerfiles and replace the Ray Docker image used there, with one from here. The image used in the reference contains Python version 3.10, CUDA version 11.8.\\n   ```\\n   FROM  rayproject/ray-ml:nightly-py310-cu118\\n   EXPOSE 6380\\n   EXPOSE 8265\\n   RUN sudo apt-get install git-lfs s3fs -y\\n   RUN git lfs install --skip-repo\\n   RUN pip install s3fs\\n   COPY /starthead.sh .\\n   RUN sudo chmod 777 /home/ray/starthead.sh\\n   RUN sudo chmod a+x /home/ray/starthead.sh\\n   RUN sudo chown ray /home/ray/starthead.sh\\n   RUN sudo chmod 777 /home/ray\\n   # ENTRYPOINT [\\&quot;bash -c\\&quot;]\\n   CMD [\\&quot;/home/ray/starthead.sh\\&quot;]\\n   ```\\n\\nNote that you will need to rebuild the docker images for the head node and the worker node and push them to a container registry, if you update the Dockerfiles. Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/blob/master/ray/README.md) for that.\\n\\n2. To update the number of worker nodes in your Ray cluster, modify the [deployment example file](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/blob/master/ray/deploy.yaml) (note that the reference deploys 6 Ray worker nodes).\\n\\n   ```\\n   version: '2.0'\\n   services:\\n   ray-head:\\n       image: thumperai/rayakash:ray-head-gpu-py310\\n       expose:\\n\\n           - port: 8265\\n           as: 8265\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4, ray-worker5\\n               - global: true\\n           - port: 6380\\n           as: 6380\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4,  ray-worker5\\n               - global: true\\n\\n           - port: 8078\\n           as: 8078\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4,  ray-worker5\\n           - port: 8079\\n           as: 8079\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4,  ray-worker5\\n           - port: 10002\\n           as: 10002\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4,  ray-worker5\\n           - port: 10003\\n           as: 10003\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4, ray-worker5\\n           - port: 10004\\n           as: 10004\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4, ray-worker5\\n           - port: 10005\\n           as: 10005\\n           to:\\n               - service: ray-worker, ray-worker1, ray-worker2, ray-worker3, ray-worker4,  ray-worker5\\n   ```\\n\\n3. You will need to add various environment variables for your AWS access key and secret (if you are using S3 for storage), MinIO access key and secret (if using MinIO) and other things:\\n\\n   - `RAY_ADDRESS_HOST`: Specifies the address of the head node. Only edit if you are trying to use ray across multiple providers.\\n   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Credentials for AWS services.\\n   - `R2_BUCKET_URL`, `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`: URLs for S3-compatible storage services.\\n   - `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID`, `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`: Credentials for Backblaze B2 storage.\\n   - `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`: Credentials for MinIO storage.\\n   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: The default AWS region for services.\\n   - `WANDB_API_KEY`, `WANDB_PROJECT`: Credentials and project name for Weights &amp; Biases logging.\\n\\n4. Update the resources needed for your specific workload, per worker, by modifying the service definition for `ray-head` and each `ray-worker` in the deployment example YAML file.\\n\\n   Once you have those things set up correctly, you can head over to [https://console.akash.network/](https://console.akash.network/) and use the template builder option to deploy your Ray cluster on Akash.\\n\\n   ![Akash Console](./akash-console-2.png)\\n\\n   ![Akash Console SDL](./akash-console-3.png)\\n\\nAnd here is a quick run through of what the whole end-to-end deployment workflow looks like:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\&quot;100%\\&quot; height=\\&quot;315\\&quot; src=\\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRsDy6rBY_A?si=b0xC1KHOZRNFPMho\\&quot; title=\\&quot;YouTube video player\\&quot; frameborder=\\&quot;0\\&quot; allow=\\&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\&quot; allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Ray-on-Akash Case Study - Akash-Thumper-1 (AT-1)\\n\\n[ThumperAI](https://thumper.ai) and [Overclock Labs](https://twitter.com/ovrclk_) (the creators of Akash Network) have been running a Ray cluster on a couple of Akash Providers for about 4 months now as part of [training a new AI foundation model](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/300) called \u201cAkash-Thumper\u201d. We intend to release the first version of that model (called \u201cAT-1\u201d) on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) soon.\\n\\nStay tuned for a set of blog posts in the coming weeks, which will delve into the details and results of the training process.\\n\\n## Getting started with Ray on Akash\\n\\nDo you use Ray for your inference, training, or fine-tuning workloads today?

Anyone who is tapped into the emerging zeitgeist among those directly involved with, and those adjacent to, the technology industry can see this playing out in real-time. [People are forming into two nascent groups](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-06/effective-accelerationism-and-beff-jezos-form-new-tech-tribe). On one side, the remains of the now-largely-discredited Effective Altruism (EA) movement argue in favor of deceleration, or taking a cautious approach to technological progress. On the other, [techno-optimists](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/) and proponents of [Effective Accelerationism (e/acc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism) advocate for [accelerating technological progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/technology/ai-acceleration.html).\\n\\nAkash has always been positioned to support the rapid advancement of technology. Overclock Labs, the creators and most prominent contributors to Akash, believe that building permissionless tools that enable open-source access to the most powerful compute resources will only bolster a rising tide that ultimately improves all of society.\\n\\n2023 was one of the most critical years in the history of Akash. Over the past year, the network passed several significant milestones that further cemented Akash\u2019s place as the premier decentralized network for cloud compute \u2014 all built by a radically open community working in public.\\n\\n## The key achievements of 2023\\n\\nTwo significant improvements led to network development in 2023. First, radically open-sourcing the entire Akash codebase (including core network deployment applications and the website) and creating an open framework for community contributions that closely resembles the structure of a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization). Second, bolstering network capabilities by adding support for GPUs \u2014 starting with NVIDIA and recently expanding to include AMD models.\\n\\n### Building a radically open community\\n\\nIn January 2023, [Akash radically opened up the process for developing the network](https://akash.network/blog/public-cloud-is-a-public-utility/) using a distributed community model that takes inspiration from [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and the DAO structure to create an entirely new open organization optimized to the needs of the Akash community.\\n\\n![The Open Akash Community](./akash-community-diagram.png)\\n\\nSpecial Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs) form the backbone of Akash\u2019s open community. These groups organize around specific objectives or deliverables and meet regularly in publicly broadcast meetings, with contributors completing work asynchronously around the world. The diagram above outlines the initial set of SIGs and WGs. Still, these groups are fluidly dynamic and change to fit the priorities of the Akash Community at any given time. Crucially, all these groups are overseen by the Steering Committee (SC), which is aware of all current projects and holds a monthly meeting to review the current project list and hear proposals for new projects and initiatives.\\n\\nOver the past number of years, many DAOs have come and gone, most sharing a similar terminology, but most have yet to be able to remain organized and deliver tangible results over an extended period. This is due to many factors, but the primary cause of dysfunction is the need for clear organization and oversight to remain consistent and well-organized over time. Without clear leadership and guidance, contributor roles can become unclear, timelines aren\u2019t created or met, and results often never appear.\\n\\nIn contrast, Akash\u2019s radically open system has already delivered on many of its promises after only one year of open operations. This year, the community will continue to publicly collaborate and look to expand the contributor base to deliver even more results \u2014 along with showcasing what is possible for a well-organized open community.\\n\\n### Launching support for NVIDIA &amp; AMD GPUs\\n\\nIn August of last year, Akash completed the [upgrade to Mainnet 6, which brought support for GPUs to the network](https://akash.network/blog/the-supercloud-for-ai-is-live/). Adding GPU support to Akash was vital to addressing the global GPU shortage, caused primarily by supply chain bottlenecks that limit the manufacturing and distribution of the most powerful GPUs mainly used for AI model training, fine-tuning, and inference.\\n\\nWhen GPU support was launched, plans were laid out for the future inclusion of other chip manufacturers, such as AMD (and support for these chips was added in late 2023). This upgrade made NVIDIA H100s and A100s, along with a wide range of consumer-grade GPUs, accessible on the network, positioning Akash as one of the leading networks to access the broadest range of compute flexibly.\\n\\nAkash serves the market for permissionless compute by focusing primarily on two segments of the GPU supply. The first segment includes high-performance chips that are often difficult to access (given the GPU shortage) but are the most performant for AI training, fine-tuning, and inference. The second segment includes consumer-grade chips which represent a massive supply of underutilized compute. These could GPUs are often repurposed from former crypto mining operations, and also from individual builders and those who have built personal computers with these chips. Akash enables both of these segments to bring this underutilized compute to market on an open and permissionless network that gives the hardware owner significant flexibility and control.\\n\\nThe proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications triggered an unprecedented surge in demand for high-performance GPUs. This demand spanned various sectors, from large corporations to startups, all facing the same compute shortage.\\n\\n### Training a foundation AI model on Akash\\n\\nBeginning in August last year, [Overclock Labs started training a foundation AI model alongside ThumperAI](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/300). This training effort will culminate in the creation of an open-source AI model named \u201cAkash-Thumper\u201d (abbreviated as AT-1), which will be open-sourced and shared on Huggingface once training is complete. This milestone showcases the potential for training AI models on a distributed network.\\n\\nThe project brought will bring three key benefits to the Akash community. First, working through the first model training will help define the process so that those who want to train models in the future will have a set of well-documented steps with a knowledge base for troubleshooting. Second, the open-source availability of AT-1 will serve as a tangible way to generate awareness of Akash and the feasibility of training on distributed compute more generally. Third, by increasing the attractiveness of Akash for training and fine-tuning AI models, we ultimately attract demand to the network, which helps to increase utilization and keep network providers consistently earning for their listed resources.\\n\\nHow the training was structured and engaged with community funding is a testament to what is possible with prudent strategic planning. The original proposal outlined a budget of $48,000, equivalent to 53,631 AKT, based on the 30-day moving average price (based on the market price at the time of the proposal). We effectively managed the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This cautious approach ensured that any unspent funds at the end of the project were either returned to the community pool or allocated towards future tenant/provider incentives. Overclock Labs' commitment to cover any shortfall further underscored our dedication to the community's sustainability. The transparency and governance in handling the project\u2019s finances, including the public sharing of the wallet address holding the funds, set a high standard for future endeavors.\\n\\n### Developing and launching Akash Chat\\n\\nThe most popular chat app, by far, is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI a little over a year ago. The app surprised the world and has already defined a new way of interacting directly with large language models (LLMs). The general public (although primarily academics and knowledge workers) rapidly adopted ChatGPT for several everyday tasks, from writing emails and copy to sparking discussions about what things the content generated by language models could be used for.\\n\\nIt quickly became apparent that an emerging problem with centralized inference apps (like ChatGPT) is the moderation control (often dubbed \u201cAI Trust &amp; Safety\u201d), which can clash with the freedom of individuals to use these applications as they would like to.\\n\\nOpen-source AI offers a solution. Distributing the models\u2019 code and weights, anyone can run these models without unnecessary restrictions. Some choose to experiment with open-source models by running them locally. Others host the models on GPUs (on-prem or in the cloud). However, a demand exists for access to open-source models in a permissionless environment without the need to handle the model's deployment.\\n\\n![Akash Chat](./akash-chat.png)\\n\\n[Akash Chat](https://chat.akash.network/) fills this need by offering an easy-to-use user interface for interacting with several of the most performant open-source models, including [Mixtral-8x7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/), [Dolphin-Mixtral](https://erichartford.com/dolphin-25-mixtral-8x7b), and [Mistral-7B](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/).\\n\\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI over a year ago, has emerged as the most popular chat interface for interacting with GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and DALL-E. Its unexpected launch redefined interactions with large language models (LLMs), quickly gaining traction among academics, knowledge workers, and the general public. This widespread adoption has been focused on various tasks, such as composing emails and generating creative content while sparking debates about the broader applications of language model-generated content.\\n\\nHowever, a notable challenge with centralized apps like ChatGPT is balancing moderation control (often referred to as \\&quot;AI Trust &amp; Safety\\&quot;) with individual freedom of use. This tension has led to a growing interest in open-source AI as an alternative. By sharing model code and weights, open-source AI allows users to operate these models without stringent restrictions. This approach has attracted users who run models locally or host them on GPUs, both on-premises and in the cloud.\\n\\nAkash Chat provides a solution to address the demand for unrestricted access to open-source models without the complexities of deployment. It offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with several leading open-source models, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mixtral, and Mistral-7B, catering to the need for a permissionless environment in AI model interaction.\\n\\n### Deploying the \u2018Akash SDXL\u2019 Inference App\\n\\nIn recent years, AI diffusion models have seen remarkable advancements, particularly in generating photo-realistic images from brief natural language prompts. These models are broadly categorized into two classes. The first includes closed-source, proprietary models like Midjourney and DALL-E, accessed through OpenAI's ChatGPT interface, which operates under consumer-facing SaaS business models. The second class comprises open-source models from entities such as StabilityAI, Meta, and Runway, which, despite being trained on proprietary datasets, release their model weights for public use and modification.\\n\\nClosed-source models, like Midjourney's v5.2, are currently leading in image quality. However, open-source models are rapidly catching up, with Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) demonstrating capabilities close to those of Midjourney and DALL-E 3, while being open-source and thus fostering permissionless development.\\n\\nAkash Network, aligning with the ethos of open-source development, has facilitated the building of SDXL on its platform. Overclock Labs developed a web application on the Akash Supercloud to demonstrate its capabilities, with key contributions from Zach Horn, Andrey Arapov, and Akash Insider Julius Haus. This project aimed to create an accessible, permissionless platform for users to interact with Akash's compute resources, showcasing the use of a variety of NVIDIA GPUs, from high-performance models like the L40 and A100 to more cost-effective options.\\n\\n![Akash SDXL](./sdxl-on-akash.png)\\n\\nThe architecture of Akash SDXL features a three-layered backend, including a websocket server, a manual load balancer, and several A1111 instances deployed across multiple GPUs. The app efficiently manages user requests, ensuring quick response times and reliability. It also includes a simple, user-friendly frontend built with React and Typescript, incorporating ChakraUI components.\\n\\nKey highlights of the Akash SDXL UI/UX include the ability for users to select GPUs for their tasks, a range of customizable inference options, and real-time performance feedback. Additionally, the app displays the global nature of the Akash Supercloud by showcasing provider locations and compute performance.\\n\\nThe development and deployment of Akash SDXL exemplify the potential of open-source Superclouds in optimizing resources for application development. This project is a testament to decentralized communities' collaborative spirit and open-source development's benefits. Akash Network continues to encourage and support developers through open bounties, paving the way for future AI deployments and broader application possibilities on the Supercloud.\\n\\n### Onboarding high-performance compute providers and validating the \u2018Repurposed ETH Miner\u2019 thesis\\n\\nAfter Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), miners who had acquired significant GPU capacity began looking for new ways to utilize this compute. This trend brought many of these former Ethereum mining operations to Akash. The most-notable example being [Foundry](https://foundrydigital.com/accelerate/)&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;one of the premier providers fo decentralized compute.\\n\\nOperating at the intersection of crypto and AI, Foundry plays a pivotal role by acting as a bridge to datacenter-grade GPUs. As we have already seen, high-performance GPUs are in massively high demadn for for machine learning and AI applications. Datacenter-grade providers like Foundry deploying their resources on Akash validates the _Repurposed ETH Miner_ thesis. It demonstrates a successful transition of mining computational resources to AI and high-performance applications.\\n\\n## The Akash Insiders &amp; the community continue to grow\\n\\nThe Akash Community plays a fundamental role in building the network and keeping our open network operations running smoothly, given the large number of SIGs and WGs, as well as social channels that make up the full scope of the community. At the core of the open community is a tight-knit group of ambassadors called the Akash Insiders, who represent the most active and involved members of the Akash community.\\n\\nThe Insiders played a fundamental role in setting the course for the events Akash will sponsor and attend in 2023 and 2024. Once the Insiders and other community members decide on the schedule for event attendance, the next step involves bringing that information to the broader community for a governance vote. Three public proposals were put onchain for a public vote for the coming year: [2024 Akash Events](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/380), [2024 Community Support](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/394), and the [2024 Akash Hackathon](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/415).\\n\\nThe Akash Insiders also grew throughout 2023. The total number of Insiders increased from 43 to 47 in Q4, many from different countries worldwide. Anyone interested in becoming a core part of the Akash community and helping to guide the broader Akash community and the wider ecosystem is [encouraged to apply](https://akash.network/community/insiders/).\\n\\nAkash also has a solid lineup of events for 2024 where the community will have a presence \u2014 starting with ETHDenver in February, where Akash will be sponsoring and will have a booth to meet and showcase the network to attendees. We will also organize AtomDenver alongside several other projects in the [Comsos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem. From there, Akash will be heading to [NVIDIA GTC](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/) in March. Then, we move on to Kubecon EU to connect with Kubernetes developers to showcase Akash\u2019s open network. These events will be excellent opportunities to connect with highly technical developers and builders to strengthen Akash\u2019s industry position.\\n\\nFinally, Akash will be sponsoring [Consensus 2024](https://consensus2024.coindesk.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAkeSsBhDUARIsAK3tieeDBZL4XMNzDj9tEeb7JjBQo05FDnXNEPfJuMoUxT_zD2zkc0Z5cLQaAtKGEALw_wcB) and leading the conference\u2019s highlighted \u2018AI Day\u2019 event. This will provide an excellent opportunity to showcase Akash as one of the leading decentralized and permissionless compute networks.\\n\\nTo see Akash's full schedule of event attendance for 2024, [see the proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/380).\\n\\n## Key media features &amp; awards in 2023\\n\\nThroughout 2023, Akash Network garnered significant media attention, which reflects the network\u2019s achievements over the past few years \u2014 but especially throughout 2023 and into this year. These media features have played a pivotal role in enhancing the Akash brand's visibility and positioning key Overclock Labs members, primarily [Greg Osuri](https://twitter.com/gregosuri) (CEO of Overclock Labs), as thought leaders in the industry.\\n\\nOne of the year's biggest highlights was our feature in a piece written by Reed Albergotti of Semafor, [\u2018The AI boom\u2019s chip shortage has an unlikely hero: the blockchain](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/25/2023/the-ai-booms-chip-shortage-has-an-unlikely-hero-the-blockchain),\u2019 which details one company\u2019s path to finding and utilizing Akash compute:\\n\\n\u201cThat led him to the Akash Network, one of a handful of companies that have created protocols to allow owners of GPUs to rent them out on the blockchain, earning tokens for every minute the GPU is utilized. Dhanani was able to access a $15,000 Nvidia A100 for $1.10 per hour through Akash. It took him about seven hours to complete his work, for about the cost of a beer.\\n\\nCompanies like Akash can offer cheaper access partly because the protocols are set up to run on their own, like a version of Airbnb or Uber without those companies taking commissions. Community members on the blockchain, incentivized with tokens, handle the nuts and bolts of the operation. As a result, the costs are low, with nobody except for the owners of the GPUs earning any significant revenue on the transaction.\u201d ([source](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/25/2023/the-ai-booms-chip-shortage-has-an-unlikely-hero-the-blockchain))\\n\\nThis highly visible mainstream feature not only showcases the power of the Akash vision for decentralized and permissionless access to compute but also emphasizes the potential of decentralized solutions to address current challenges in cloud computing.\\n\\nGreg Osuri was also quoted in the Washington Post in an article titled, \u201c[Why Nvidia is suddenly one of the most valuable companies in the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/25/nvidia-ai-stock-gpu-chatbots/),\u201d focusing on the earnings performance of NVIDIA. Inclusion in one of the most prominent feature stories on one of the top AI hardware manufacturers showcases Akash\u2019s prominence in the industry, both as a recognized network for decentralized compute and as a thought leader in the space.\\n\\nAkash and Greg Osuri were featured multiple times throughout 2023 in Blockworks and its subsidiary outlets, most notably on the 0xResearch podcast, '[How Akash Network is Democratizing Access to Cloud GPUs](https://blockworks.co/podcast/0xresearch/09906c88-7381-11ee-b6e0-0f7a3092d4d3).' Another prominent feature was in an article from October titled, '[Cloud computing is operated by an anti-competitive oligopoly, says Osuri](https://blockworks.co/news/cloud-services-0xresearch-competition).' Finally, Osuri participated in a webinar alongside [Tommy Eastman](https://twitter.com/tommyeastman21) of Foundry, and [James Woodman](https://twitter.com/jameswoodmanv) of the Opentensor Foundation, '[Decentralizing AI: The Intersection of AI, Blockchain and GPU Computing](https://blockworks.co/webinar/decentralizing-ai-the-intersection-of-ai-blockchain-and-gpu-computing).'\\n\\n## Looking ahead to 2024\\n\\nIn 2024, the primary goal for the network is to push progress forward on the groundwork laid in 2023. First, by scaling the network by onboarding high-performance compute providers (focusing on providers with high-performance NVIDIA GPUs \u2014 primarily H100s and A100s \u2014 along with midrange datacenter models and those with access to large quantities of 30-series and above consumer GPUs). Second, by expanding contributions from our open community. This is critical to building the features and applications that will allow the network to scale over the coming years.\\n\\nIn a recent essay by Vitalik Buterin, '[My techno-optimism](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html),' which was itself a reaction to Marc Andreessen\u2019s '[The Techno-Optimist Manifesto](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/),' Vitalik outlined his vision of d/acc (a fork of e/acc). In his definition, d/acc stands for Defensive (alternatively: Decentralized or Differential) Acceleration. The defining characteristic of d/acc is its stance on accelerating technological progress while remaining cautious about the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of corporations \u2014 as we have [already seen with the cloud industry](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-30-gartner-says-cloud-concentration-now-a-significant-emerging-risk-for-many-organizations). Akash directly supports the d/acc movement by providing decentralized access to compute, which will help prevent concentrations in power and control in the hands of a few large corporations.\\n\\nSpecifically, we believe several trends will evolve over the next year that will bolster Akash\u2019s role in contributing to the development of permissionless compute to power AI and decentralized applications.\\n\\n**The continued rise of open-source AI.** The increasing popularity of open-source AI is a notable trend. It allows developers to build on existing work, reducing costs and expanding access to AI technologies. Projects like Stable Diffusion and AutoGPT have seen significant engagement, making sophisticated AI models and tools more accessible to smaller entities. Open-source AI fosters transparency and ethical development, although concerns about the misuse of AI to create disinformation persist.\\n\\n**Agentic AI.** Marking a shift from reactive to proactive AI, agentic AI systems exhibit autonomy and the ability to act independently. They understand their environment, set goals, and work to achieve these objectives without direct human intervention. This development is significant in environmental monitoring and finance, where AI agents can autonomously manage tasks like forest fire prevention or investment portfolios. The combination of agentic and multimodal AI can further expand the capabilities of AI systems, making them more efficient and versatile. Autonomous Agents and Personalization: The future of AI sees a move towards more personalized and autonomous agents that require less user intervention. These agents are expected to understand high-level intents and execute a series of actions on behalf of users, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.\\n\\n**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).** To mitigate the issue of \\&quot;hallucinations\\&quot; in AI-generated content, RAG combines text generation with information retrieval. This technique enhances the accuracy and relevance of AI responses, especially in enterprise applications where factual knowledge is critical. RAG reduces model size, increasing speed and lowering costs, making it an attractive option for businesses seeking efficient and informative AI tools like chatbots and virtual assistants.\\n\\n**Defining the scope of AI Trust &amp; Safety.** With the growing adoption of AI in enterprises, there is an increased focus on AI governance. This includes controlling how employees use AI technology and ensuring compliance with government regulations. Effective governance is crucial for mitigating risks associated with AI use, such as data breaches and intellectual property issues. Organizations are also looking to influence potential regulations and prepare for upcoming ones, reflecting the importance of proactive engagement in the regulatory landscape.\\n\\n### Scaling Akash with provider incentives\\n\\nNow that Akash has reached a near-consistent [50% network utilization](https://x.com/gregosuri/status/1731385370757996694?s=20), it is the right time to begin incentivizing providers to increase the supply of compute on the network. Given ~50% utilization, demand should scale proportionally alongside the increase in supply, as the network has achieved product-market fit (PMF).\\n\\nThe Akash Provider Incentives program is still in development and will launch soon. [Follow Akash on X](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) to stay current as provider incentives roll out.\\n\\n![Akash reaches consistent ~50% utilization](./akash-utilization.jpeg)\\n\\n## Accelerating the Supercloud in 2024 and beyond\\n\\n2023 was a defining year for Akash, and 2024 is already shaping up to continue that progress and expand on it as the network focuses on scaling supply, demand, and core functionality. Last year, the network's milestones, including the radical open-sourcing of the process that builds the network and the launch of GPU support, laid a foundation for the core initiatives planned for the coming year. Provider incentives will bring more compute onto the network and help to scale demand (given the network\u2019s ~50% utilization and PMF), which in turn will help to create a flywheel of growth that will only build over time.\\n\\nIn addition, the growth of the Akash Community, with its unique open structure comprised of SIGs and WGs, has been pivotal in driving the development of the network. This radically open approach has enabled a level of collaboration not possible with closed-source projects and companies. Open-source development and deployment of apps like Akash SDXL and Akash Chat only serves to showcase this progress.\\n\\nEmerging trends will continue to shape the industry, including the rise of open-source and decentralized AI, agentic AI, RAG applications, and the evolving role of AI Trust and Safety. Akash Network's alignment and support of these trends, coupled with its commitment to community-led development and rapid technological acceleration, positions the network to play a significant role in the industry\u2019s progress \u2014 poised to drive unprecedented growth in 2024 and beyond.\\n\\n---\\n\\n_If you\u2019re interested in contributing to Akash, there are several ways to get involved.

And with 2024 upon us, we\u2019re offering a recap of the past quarter for Overclock Labs and Akash Network.\\n\\n## Completed Mainnet upgrades 7, 8, and 9\\n\\nAlso in November, Akash launched several upgrades to its Supercloud, enabling developers to more easily access high-end chips such as NVIDIA A100s and H100s.\\n\\n- [Mainnet 7](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1722603953131524222?s=20): Akash completed a network configuration upgrade that unlocked massively increased deployment sizes. This allows Akash to coordinate resource-intensive workloads \u2013 most importantly, the training of AI models on distributed compute.\\n- [Mainnet 8](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1726630103302492283?s=20):With this upgrade, developers can come to the network with a budget in mind and secure access to GPUs faster than before, eliminating the back-and-forth associated with bidding.\\n- [Mainnet 9](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1729555310073766043?s=20): In less than 5 minutes and with coordination from network validators, Akash upgraded to Mainnet 9, which included a minor change to ensure properly validated bids on multi-service deployments.\\n\\n## Kicked Off Thumper.ai Foundation Model Training\\n\\nIn October, we published the proposal to begin [re-training](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1710041499671687259?s=20) a Stable Diffusion model using a creative commons dataset in partnership with generative AI platform Thumper.ai. The proposal passed a few days later with resounding support from the community for this [first-ever initiative](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/25/2023/the-ai-booms-chip-shortage-has-an-unlikely-hero-the-blockchain) on a permissionless network.\\n\\nWhile the experiment is still underway, Akash provided 24,000 NVIDIA A100 (80GB) hours to Thumper to code and train the model, and we\u2019ll be publishing the model and code to Hugging Face soon. The result will be an image-generation AI model that can be used without the risk of copyright infringement, and will round out Akash\u2019s capabilities to support the three most popular AI tasks: training, fine-tuning, and inferencing.\\n\\n## Akash SDXL &amp; Akash Chat\\n\\nIn December, the network demonstrated that developers can tap a variety of GPUs \u2013 not just the fastest and highest-performing (which are hard for many companies to secure) \u2013 for AI imaging and chat models, paving the way for a new wave of open-source and permissionless AI applications.\\n\\n- **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) for imaging:** This image-generation app has generated over [46,000 images](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1734247634506838372) at no cost to developers, and is hosted on a wide range of NVIDIA GPUs, including L40s, A100s, V100s, RTX-8000s, and 3090s.\\n- **Akash Chat:** A zero-cost, permissionless application to easily chat with the leading open-source models is now available and hosted on a variety of GPUs available on the cloud, including A100s, V100s, and RTX 3090s.\\n\\n## NVIDIA L40s Live on the Network\\n\\nAkash is constantly sourcing new opportunities to harness idle GPU capacity \u2013 including [Foundry](https://foundrydigital.com/) and other providers \u2013 that will give people the compute power to train, fine-tune, and run inference for AI applications.\\n\\nIn November, we [announced](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1722673189237490094?s=20) that NVIDIA L40, one of the highest-performing GPUs in the world, was live on the Akash Supercloud, which has enabled greater availability of the next-generation chips, driving compute-intensive workloads.\\n\\n## Additional Highlights\\n\\n- **The market has taken notice:** Messari featured Akash in two ([1](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1708869832043631087?s=20), [2](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1719432757896421695?s=20)) infrastructure reports and Reflexivity in [another](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1708866621173801238) in October, and Blockworks [detailed](https://twitter.com/blockworksres/status/1732401228687315366?s=20) the network's multi-phased token economics plan to scale and lower the barriers to high-performance compute even more in December. Additionally, Coinage [nominated](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1725614932400419126?s=20) us as the Crypto Project of the Year, while Decrypt has [spotlighted](https://twitter.com/decryptmedia/status/1717224504525561868) our work for Achievement in AI.\\n- **Enabling more efficient product development:** With our [latest integration](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1730664115528442303?s=20) with SubQuery, which supports rapid data indexing, builders can manage and query on-chain with ease for their protocols and applications.\\n- **Connecting with the AI community:** Earlier this month, Greg Osuri, founder of Akash Network, [spoke at](https://twitter.com/gregosuri/status/1729571486447411315?s=20) the Decentralized AI Summit alongside Logan Cerkovnik, founder, CEO, and CTO of Thumper.ai, to discuss how the decentralized, permissionless network can support AI builders.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nThe GPU squeeze is real and is being felt across large and small companies. The most popular solution to the GPU squeeze is to boost the output of the most expensive, advanced GPUs \u2013 particularly A100s and H100s \u2013 and for the big tech giants to manufacture those chips. While that\u2019s great news for the largest AI companies, it does not reduce price or market concentration. Next year, less powerful GPUs available on the Akash Supercloud will help sustain the AI boom, and mitigate concerns that larger players will continue to dominate the next era of tech transformation.\\n\\nWe're grateful for your support and involvement in our community\u2013especially in our [Hackathon](https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1715435561392222384?s=20) earlier this fall\u2013and are excited to work together to build from here.

The models at the forefront of the space have developed from the ability to produce rough approximations of images based on an engineered text prompt to the capability of producing photo-realistic images from a natural language prompt as short as a few words.\\n\\nThere are two main classes of models available today. The first class is closed-source proprietary models offered through consumer-facing inference applications with SaaS business models. This closed-source class includes apps like Midjourney and DALL-E (accessed through OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT interface). The second class is open-source models. These are often trained on proprietary datasets, but the resulting model weights are published for anyone to use and modify. This class includes models from StabilityAI, Meta, Runway, and others.\\n\\nAs many would expect, the first class of closed-source models has gained an edge in image quality. Midjourney\u2019s v5.2 is currently regarded as the best model on the market in terms of overall subjective image quality. However, open-source models such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) are rapidly gaining popularity and closing the gap in image quality.\\n\\nOpen-source models are not far behind. Stability AI released Stable Diffusion XL this past July, which can produce high-quality 1024x1024 images with comparable quality to Midjourney and DALL-E 3. However, unlike these models, SDXL is open-source.\\n\\nOpen-source is essential for enabling permissionless development. Akash has always been aligned with this principle \u2014 the network\u2019s code and the [surrounding development community are both radically open](https://akash.network/blog/public-cloud-is-a-public-utility/).\\n\\nTo build Akash SDXL, the team at [Overclock Labs](https://twitter.com/ovrclk_) set out to develop a simple web application to demonstrate the benefits of building with the Akash Supercloud. The development of Akash SDXL was managed by [Zach Horn](https://twitter.com/zacharyhorn), with technical support from Andrey Arapov from Overclock Labs, and developed by Akash Insider [Julius Haus](https://twitter.com/zJu_u).\\n\\nThe three objectives for Akash SDXL:\\n\\n1. Develop a simple yet performant web application to allow users to complete inference of SDXL.\\n2. Showcase GPUs on the Akash Supercloud from the highest-performance NVIDIA L40 and A100 to more cost-effective 40 and 30 series chips.\\n3. Serve as a zero-cost, permissionless touchpoint for Akash, allowing new users to interact with compute resources coordinated through Akash without the need to authenticate.\\n\\n## The benefits of building on the Akash Supercloud\\n\\nAkash provides several unique benefits that make the network well-suited to developing applications using open-source AI models running on heterogeneous compute.\\n\\n**Access to high-performance GPUs**. Akash currently provides access to a wide range of GPU types. The network has been extensively tested across many of the most utilized NVIDIA GPU models. These include the L40, H100, A100, V100, A8000, A6000, 4090, 4080, 3090, 3080, and many more.\\n\\n**The ability to easily combine compute resources.** The power of Akash lies in its flexibility when mixing heterogeneous cloud resources across multiple deployments within a single application. We\u2019ll touch on how this applies to the architecture of Akash SDXL shortly.\\n\\n**Flexibility in optimizing price and performance.** Akash's true power and performance shine through when extracting the most performance from a finite budget. Because of the network\u2019s flexibility in terms of mixing resource types, it is possible to blend GPU types with different price and performance levels seamlessly. For example, Akash SDXL has multiple instances deployed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs and RTX-3090s. If the user selects the A100 and 3090 options within the UI, the app will route to whichever GPU is available when the generation request is sent. A developer on a constrained resource budget could seamlessly allocate their resources in favor of lower-cost GPUs like the 3090 and deprioritize higher-cost (yet higher-performance) GPUs like the L40 or A100. Conversely, developers aiming for the highest possible performance and higher cost flexibility could weigh their deployments in favor of NVIDIA L40, H100, and A100 models. One of the most robust features of the network is the ability to architect the application in a way that provides complete control over the compute mix.\\n\\nBelow, we\u2019ll cover how these benefits translate across the developer experience when building on Akash. First, we\u2019ll briefly cover our thought process in choosing an open-source AI model.\\n\\n## Development of Akash SDXL\\n\\nThe idea to create the app that eventually became Akash SDXL evolved as a collaboration between Overclock Labs and the Akash community.\\n\\nOur goal in creating [Akash SDXL](https://sdxl.akash.network) was an easy-to-access, permissionless touchpoint for users to interact with Akash compute. Development began with work that Julius started during the Akash Mainnet 6 testnet. At that time, the initial version of the app could turn standard black-and-white QR codes into custom images styled according to a prompt but maintaining the functionality of the base QR code. In developing this AIQRArt, zJ became versed in Automatic1111 (A1111) \u2014 a Gradio-based web UI for working with diffusion models \u2014 and its API. With the launch of SDXL, which was released shortly after the [Akashathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/167), we decided to pursue building and deploying this app on Akash.\\n\\n![Akash SDXL application architecture](./A1111backend.png)\\n\\nThe backend of Akash SDXL is built with three layers. The top layer consists of a websocket server the user connects to from [sdxl.akash.network](https://sdxl.akash.network). This server validates the user's input and sends a POST request with the values required for image generation to the web server in the middle layer. To ensure that the A1111 instance is correctly configured, the settings are also updated in a previous step with the associated interface.\\n\\nThe middle layer consists of a manual load balancer written in Typescript and provides a redirect to the Rest-API of the A1111 instance via an Express webserver. The primary function of the load balancer is to prevent multiple user requests from queuing on a single instance, which would result in long wait times for completed generations.\\n\\nThe lowest layer consists of several A1111 instances with activated Rest-APIs deployed on multiple GPUs across several Akash providers. The current provider mix utilizes GPUs from Foundry Staking, Europlots, Akashost, and Overclock Labs. Across these providers, the app currently runs inference on NVIDIA L40, A100, V100, RTX-8000, and RTX-3090. Once deployed, these instances automatically install the SDXL base model and refiner and are ready to generate images immediately after startup.\\n\\nAs it is always possible for a server in the middle or lower levels to fail, an NGINX load balancer was added at the connection points between the top and middle layers and the middle and lower layers to forward traffic to redundant backup servers in case one of the primary servers fails.\\n\\nAPI requests that are routed to the A1111 Rest-API are formatted in this way:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n\\&quot;prompt\\&quot;: \\&quot;prompt\\&quot;,\\n\\&quot;negative_prompt\\&quot;: \\&quot;negative_prompt\\&quot;,\\n\\&quot;batch_size\\&quot;: 1,\\n\\&quot;steps\\&quot;: 20,\\n\\&quot;cfg_scale\\&quot;: 7,\\n\\&quot;sampler_name\\&quot;: \\&quot;DPM++ 2M Karras\\&quot;,\\n\\&quot;width\\&quot;: 1024,\\n\\&quot;height\\&quot;: 1024,\\n\\&quot;refiner_checkpoint\\&quot;: \\&quot;sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors\\&quot;,\\n\\&quot;refiner_switch_at\\&quot;: 0.8 // switch at total_steps*0.8\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo develop the API request, we first updated the settings of the A1111 instance with a POST request to the /sdapi/v1/options endpoint. Because only some settings are relevant and some already contain values, they must be updated in the POST request. The most important settings are for the selected models \\&quot;sd_model_checkpoint\\&quot;: \\&quot;sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors [31e35c80fc]\\&quot;, and \\&quot;sd_checkpoints_limit\\&quot;: 2, so that the user can quickly switch to the refiner model. Every value can be set easily with a GET request to the /sdapi/v1/options endpoint. Once these settings are correctly configured, generating an image is as simple as sending these values to the /sdapi/v1/txt2img endpoint with a POST request. Once the POST request is sent, you will get a Base64 encoded image ready to be processed and sent to the end user.\\n\\nA1111 is currently one of the most user-friendly ways to generate images with open-source AI models. It offers many settings and extensions that allow anyone with a reasonably powerful GPU to create images. However, this ease of use comes with limitations that are particularly evident in the multi-stage creation of images (a technique becoming more popular with application developers and professional creatives). Multi-stage creation requires an interface allowing finer control over the generation process.\\n\\n[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), a newer user interface rapidly gaining popularity, is well-suited to handle multi-stage image generation. The interface and API are significantly more flexible and perform better than A1111. It features a node-based UI where the user can set and connect many separate nodes, each of which handles a different aspect of the creation process. Initially, developing these multi-node functions can appear complex. Still, this process offers a more significant upside regarding flexibility in tailoring the final image output above and beyond what is possible in A1111.\\n\\nTo handle user input in a way that was ultimately scalable, we developed a simple frontend \u2014 hosted at [sdxl.akash.network](https://sdxl.akash.network) \u2014 to intake user input and display completed image generations. The website leverages React and is written entirely in Typescript. We also integrated components from [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to create a seamless, easy-to-use interface.\\n\\nDepending on the GPU model, Most generated images only take a few seconds to complete. We wanted to show the user the inference time required for the generation to showcase the speed of the high-performance GPUs and the potential effectiveness of consumer-grade GPUs (which are slower for inference than their datacenter counterparts but often much less expensive). To accomplish this, we used a websocket server that connects bi-directionally to the website to reduce the number of HTTPS requests.\\n\\nDeploying the entire app on Akash was seamless. It only required minimal prior knowledge of Docker and the [Stack Definition Language (SDL)](https://akash.network/docs/readme/stack-definition-language) \u2014 the native templating language for the Akash marketplace that allows users to detail the compute requirements for their deployment. Most importantly, the Akash Supercloud provided easy access to the wide range of GPU models needed to power the app. The Akash community had already created the required Docker images. Finally, we used environment variables to store sensitive data, such as access data for the LogDB.\\n\\n## UI/UX Highlights\\n\\nThere are four primary ways we surface Akash compute through the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of Akash SDXL.\\n\\n**User access to GPU selection.** Users are given the option to toggle the GPU type that will run the inference. This allows users to experiment with compute from a range of NVIDIA GPUs, including the L40, A100, V100, RTX-8000, and RTX-3090. Each GPU provides a different level of performance at different prices. This allows users to understand the price-to-performance balance for their specific needs, whether that balance is weighted towards higher efficiency or more processing power for faster generation or higher-resolution images.\\n\\n**A tailored set of inference options.** The application gives the user control of a selection of inference options to customize the generation process. By narrowing the scope of inference optionality from all possible options to only a few, the app remains easy to use while still providing a degree of image customization. The primary user input comes from the Prompt and Negative Prompt, which guide the model to produce an image with the keywords included in the prompt and remove aspects of the image based on keywords in the negative prompt. Upon opening the app, the user encounters the default prompt `futuristic city with neon lights, rainy streets, bright colors, detailed`, which gives new users a sense of the prompt structure that is optimal for inference. These prompts are typically short keywords or phrases separated by commas, and the negative prompt follows the same prompting syntax.\\n\\nThe 'Sampler Name' dropdown allows the users to choose from a selection of popular Stable Diffusion samplers (an algorithm that generates images by iteratively refining random noise into coherent visual content based on learned patterns). Each sampler can affect the output differently, so the user can experiment with each sampler to discover which works best to achieve their desired result. When loading the app, the sampler defaults to `DPM++ SDE Karras`. Although sampler preference can often be subjective, DPM++ SDE Karras offers a near-optimal mix of image quality and fast generation speeds at relatively low step counts (Akash SDXL is hard-coded to run inference at 25 steps).\\n\\nLastly, the `Refiner Switch` presented with a slider, allows users to determine the point at which the refiner should take over in the image creation process. The diagram below shows the image production process in SDXL and how the refiner interacts with the base model to produce the final 1024x1024 image.\\n\\n![SDXL Diagram](./pipeline.png)\\n\\n**Provider locations.** One of the most striking features of the Akash Supercloud is the global nature of the network. Akash currently features compute providers from around the world. In designing Akash SDXL, we wanted to surface the provider name and location directly during image generation to showcase how seamlessly the network can distribute user requests to providers worldwide.\\n\\n![Foundry GPU v100](./foundry-gpu-v100.png)\\n\\n**Displays the total inference time for each generation.** The app also provides users with real-time feedback on the performance of its image generation process by displaying the inference time required to create each image. Surfacing performance metrics in the app allows users to gauge the performance of each GPU relative to each other. It is a benchmark for the application's performance (including the time required to generate the image on the GPU itself).\\n\\n## The path forward for AI deployments on the Supercloud\\n\\nThe process of building Akash SDXL demonstrates the power and flexibility of an open-source Supercloud to combine and optimize resources for building applications. The development process also shows how decentralized communities can collaborate to work on projects in a radically open manner \u2014 producing open-source code for public benefit along the way.\\n\\nAny developers interested in building applications on Akash (both AI-focused and otherwise) can participate in open bounties that are offered to the entire community, including new developers who would like to join the Akash community. Currently available bounties can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/akash-network/community).\\n\\nAkash SDXL is only the first of many AI deployments to come. As new applications for distributed Akash compute are realized, there will only be more opportunities to grow awareness of the potential of the Supercloud.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Building an SDXL Inference App on the Akash Supercloud&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In less than two years, AI diffusion models have improved exponentially&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/sdxl-on-akash-network._bWFBUnh.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/building-an-sdxl-inference-app-on-the-akash-supercloud/sdxl-on-akash-network.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;mainnet-8-gpu-visibility-upgrades/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;mainnet-8-gpu-visibility-upgrades&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAs the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications has come to a head, large corporations and agile startups are still struggling to secure access to high-performance GPUs. This is especially true for some of the largest corporations who have traditionally not had any trouble in ensuring compute to power their innovations\u2013\u2013resulting in even tighter squeezes for access to compute resources. As such, developers are turning to alternative cloud networks like Akash to train and fine-tune their AI models.\\n\\nThis past Sunday, November 19th, Akash successfully completed the upgrade to Mainnet 8. This upgrade brought several quality-of-life improvements to the network, including increasing GPU visibility and giving providers more flexibility during the bidding process to streamline the deployment process \u2014 especially as [GPU utilization increases](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/graph/graphics-gpu) as network usage grows.\\n\\nA brief overview of the core feature included with this upgrade, as outlined in [Akash\u2019s Discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/projects/5/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=41817276).\\n\\n## Increasing GPU visibility\\n\\nOne of the most important ways to ensure adoption of the Akash Supercloud is to ensure that the deployment process is seamless and intuitive. Mainnet 8 lays the foundation for an improved deployment experience by enabling deployers to come to the network with a budget in mind and specify which GPU attributes they\u2019re seeking during the bidding process.\\n\\nBelow is an example of a bid prior to the Mainnet 8 upgrade, which did not include GPU attributes. The lack of specific GPU model attributes made it difficult for deployers to have visibility into the types of resources they were receiving bids for during the provider selection stage of the bidding process, resulting in more information being surfaced at the right time to ensure deployers are satisfied with the resources provided and agreement made.\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\&quot;bid\\&quot;: {\\n

\\&quot;0.000000000000000000\\&quot;\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFocusing on the `resources_offer` section, we can see that the bid now includes a key and value that includes the GPU vendor and model, in this case, an NVIDIA A100 GPU. This will allow deployers to see which specific GPU models are being offered when a bid is received, along with allowing Akash deployment clients (such as Cloudmos Deploy) to surface the GPU model attributes in the deployment UIs.\\n\\n```\\n\\&quot;attributes\\&quot;: [\\n    {\\n    \\&quot;key\\&quot;: \\&quot;vendor/nvidia/model/a100\\&quot;,\\n    \\&quot;value\\&quot;: \\&quot;true\\&quot;\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThe `resources_offer` details returned by the Akash Provider are particularly useful when a deployment is created with a list of acceptable GPU models. For example, a deployment may be created in which the tenant includes both NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs as acceptable and appropriate for the application. Previously, a tenant would not receive any details from the provider on what type of model was used in the bid response.\\n\\nWhile either the A100 or H100 may be sufficient for the application, the deployer should be presented with the model used in the bid for more intelligent selection from amongst the list of bids. Now armed with the Resources Offer details, the deployer will know explicitly if the provider is including an A100 or H100 in the bid offer.\\n\\n## Daily network revenue hits an all-time high\\n\\nSince the launch of the GPU marketplace as part of the Mainnet 6 upgrade, network usage has been steadily climbing. As seen in the charts below, daily network revenue (measured here as daily USD spend, which is based on the underlying AKT spend on the network) is at an all-time high.\\n\\nThis is fueled in part by the start of the [Akash-Thumper AI foundation model training](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/300) \u2014 marking the first time this has been done on a decentralized platform \u2014 and the continued growth of [Akash SDXL](https://sdxl.akash.network), but also by increased adoption of the network by those looking for on-demand and high-performance compute.\\n\\n![AKT Daily Spend, 1 Month](./daily-spend-1-mo.png)\\n\\nThe chart below shows daily network revenue since the network inception, which puts the current surge in usage in perspective.\\n\\n![AKT Daily Spend, All-time](./daily-spend-all-time.png)\\n\\n## Get started with deploying on Akash\\n\\nFor more detailed technical information on the Mainnet 8 upgrade, head over to the [Akash Docs](https://akash.network/docs/akash-mainnet8-upgrade) to see the in-depth provider and node upgrade instructions, along with information to set up an Akash provider and deploy via the CLI.\\n\\nFor a user-friendly deployment experience, head to [Cloudmos Deploy](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/) to see available network resources and to get started with your deployment.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Mainnet 8: GPU Visibility Upgrades&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications has come to a head, large corporations and agile startups are still struggling to secure access to high-performance GPUs.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2023-11-21T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/akash-mainnet-8.BdecSrcj.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/mainnet-8-gpu-visibility-upgrades/akash-mainnet-8.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-supercloud-for-ai-is-live/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-supercloud-for-ai-is-live&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n- Starting today, Akash is launching capabilities for its Supercloud to offer GPUs\\n- The network now supports NVIDIA GPUs, with options for others such as AMD in the future\\n- The network has successfully hosted NVIDIA H100s and A100s, plus a range of consumer-grade GPUs\\n- Access to consumer-grade GPUs is one way the Akash Supercloud stands apart\\n\\nSilicon is the story of the next decade \u2013 and the next big chapter for Akash. The industry that turns sand into semiconductors, and then into fabricated chips, weaves together a network of suppliers, chip fabricators (fabs), manufacturers, and cloud service providers around the world, all of whom coordinate to serve a market hungry for compute to power the development of the greatest invention of the modern era \u2014 AI.\\n\\nUpstream, the market is controlled by massive multinational players. The largest is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which [controls 55.5% of the worldwide foundry market](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP50994023#:~:text=The%20leading%20vendor%2C%20TSMC%2C%20has,pick%20up%20further%20in%202023). At the unit manufacturing level, NVIDIA, AMD, and others manufacture these chips into Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The GPUs these companies produce are highly sought after for their ability to run processes in parallel \u2014 an ability tailor-made for the complex operations required by AI.\\n\\nAs a result of the proliferation of capable Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications, high-performance GPUs are experiencing the highest demand surge in recent history. Everyone, from the largest corporations to the most agile startups, is scrambling to secure access.\\n\\n## The Distribution and Demand for GPUs\\n\\nAs the most in-demand GPUs make their way to market, they are distributed primarily to corporations and hyperscale cloud service providers (CSPs), who have the vast resources needed to acquire and operate these high-priced GPUs. For hyperscale cloud providers, access to these GPUs represents a strong selling point and offers a way to attract customers who prefer to access compute on-demand.\\n\\nFor those looking for on-demand compute, it\u2019s not always easy to find. Users of CSPs are forced to accept permissioned access and the risk of vendor lock-in, and this is only if the desired GPU units are even available. Given the intense demand, it\u2019s common for the highest-performance GPUs to be prioritized for reserved instances, in which the cloud service provider \u201cpre-sells\u201d or reserves access to specific quantities of GPUs for a predetermined length of time. These reserve instances are often expensive and are often prioritized for the largest customers who see cost as secondary to control and access.\\n\\n## Building the Open-Source Supercloud for AI\\n\\nAkash addresses these inefficiencies with the first operational Supercloud, a \u201ccloud of clouds,\u201d or a way to permissionlessly access compute resources \u2013 including GPUs \u2013 from a range of providers, from independent to hyperscale. The network that powers the Supercloud has been in the making for nearly seven years. During that time, it has matured and been battle-tested across various cloud services and specific use cases. The network has onboarded cloud resource providers and coordinated leases for compute resources with deployers around the world.\\n\\nEach major iteration of the network\u2019s development is marked by a Mainnet upgrade. During these upgrades, the network migrates to a new version of the network code. Each Mainnet upgrade brings new features to the network. Today, the network is completing one of the most significant Mainnet upgrades.\\n\\n## Mainnet 6: The Akash GPU Mainnet\\n\\nThe network\u2019s sixth Mainnet upgrade brings GPU support, Stable Payments, and Take Rates to Akash. Starting today, providers on the network will be able to offer GPU resources to deployers around the world, and both providers and deployers will have access to USDC settlement. At settlement, the network will begin capturing value via Take Rates on both USDC and AKT.\\n\\nThe upcoming mainnet upgrade will bring the following features to Akash.\\n\\n### GPU Marketplace\\n\\nThe main feature of the upgrade will enable an open-source marketplace for high-density GPUs. This will be accomplished by adapting Akash\u2019s existing Supercloud infrastructure to allow network providers to support GPUs. This initial upgrade will focus support and testing on NVIDIA, given the AI and machine learning industry\u2019s preference for NVIDIA GPUs. In the future, the network will focus support and testing on other manufacturers, including AMD and others.\\n\\nGPU support has already been [validated in the Akash GPU Testnet](https://akash.network/blog/testing-the-first-ai-supercloud/) (a public beta test of the GPU network features, AI deployments, and benchmarking). Over 1,300 people signed up to participate, and the testnet hosted NVIDIA H100s, and A100s, along with consumer-grade GPUs from the 30-series and 40-series. Access to consumer-grade GPUs is one way the Akash Supercloud stands apart from other cloud providers. These models are typically overlooked, even though they can often run inference on less memory-intensive AI models. The flexibility to choose from the widest possible range of GPUs makes the Supercloud powerful.\\n\\n### Stable Payments\\n\\nThe second most anticipated feature of the upgrade is the addition of Stable Payments, which is part of the [larger AKT 2.0 initiative](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/32). Although many features and advantages are built into AKT, Akash\u2019s native utility token, any token with inherent volatility presents a challenge to long-term providers and deployers. Significant price movements can drastically change the value of the cloud services rendered as part of the lease agreement coordinated through Akash\u2019s open marketplace. One solution to the long-term volatility challenge is to incorporate alternative settlement currencies. For the rollout of Stable Payments, that currency will be USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the future, additional settlement currencies can be added with a simple governance proposal.\\n\\n### Take Rates\\n\\nFor the network to capture value and direct resources toward building the network and rewarding participants, there must be a mechanism for the network to capture value.\\n\\nThe mechanism for capturing value at the network level is called Take Rates. These rates are applied to each lease and can be changed at any time with a governance vote. The network Take Rates will initially be set at 4% for AKT and 20% for USDC.\\n\\n[Read the original draft proposal of both Stable Payments and Take Rates](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/147) for an overview of the specific features of each.\\n\\n## Joining the Supercloud\\n\\nThe world is waking up to a new technological landscape, shaped by the exponential growth of AI, that carries a vastly higher demand for compute. As upstream manufacturers experience bottlenecks and logistical hurdles, access to GPU compute becomes an existential risk to downstream players like startups and cloud service providers.\\n\\nThis is why now is the perfect time to bring GPUs to the Supercloud. As the network grows, it will only become more powerful, hosting greater and greater quantities of GPUs from providers around the world while becoming an integrated part of the infrastructure powering AI development. It is more important than ever that these challenges are addressed with a fully open-source network \u2014 which prevents control of these resources from concentrating in the hands of a few large corporations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n_Learn more about the Supercloud from a technical perspective with the [Akash Docs](https://akash.network/docs/).

The Supercloud concept was initially theorized by [Cornell University](http://supercloud.cs.cornell.edu/) and [MIT](https://supercloud.mit.edu/), before being practically applied in the [Akash Network whitepaper](https://akash-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/03/akash-econ.pdf). The network has already developed a robust marketplace for cloud resources, and the addition of GPUs will allow the network to power the development of AI. Once GPU support is live following the Akash GPU Mainnet upgrade, the world will have access to an open marketplace for high-density GPUs available to everyone, from individuals to enterprises.\\n\\nLet\u2019s look back at the most important testnet highlights and the key contributors before looking ahead to the Akash GPU Mainnet upgrade.\\n\\n## Key Achievements From the Akash GPU Testnet\\n\\nGiven the permissionless nature of Akash Network, the testnet was open to anyone around the world, and participants could interact with the new network features in any way they chose. To balance the widely open nature of the testnet with the need to validate the network for a specific set of criteria, Overclock Labs designed a controlled series of tasks that participants could complete to earn rewards. This ensured that the network was rigorously tested across a range of GPU types and AI model deployments and that the network would perform reliably after the upcoming mainnet upgrade.\\n\\nThe series of structured and incentivized tasks were divided into four main categories.\\n\\n### Onboarding GPU Providers\\n\\nSetting up GPU providers on Akash is one of the most important network features that will allow the AI Supercloud to become fully functional. One of the main goals of the testnet was to observe the provider setup process in a live production environment, identify and fix potential bugs or other issues, and receive feedback on the network\u2019s UX from participants \u2014 who ranged from independent enthusiasts to highly experienced datacenter operators.\\n\\nThese were the key achievements from the GPU provider setup task:\\n\\n- **A wide range of NVIDIA GPU models.** The testnet hosted GPUs from the highest-performing datacenter models (like the H100/A100) to widely-available consumer GPUs. The specific NVIDIA models that were incentivized for the testnet included: H100, A100, V100, P100, A40, A10, P4, K80, T4, 4090, 4080, 3090Ti, 3090, 3080Ti, 3080, 3060Ti.\\n- **High performance at both ends of the GPU range.** NVIDIA H100 and A100 models performed well on inference tasks for larger models and apps, while consumer-grade models in the 40-series and 30-series range performed well on compact models like [Falcon-7B](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1668727064411635712?s=20).\\n- **Worldwide coverage.** Providers onboarded permissionlessly from around the world and successfully connected with deployers in many different countries worldwide.\\n\\n### Deploying AI Workloads\\n\\nParticipants also deployed the leading open-source AI models on available GPU providers. This step was crucial to ensure that not only would high-parameter LLMs run efficiently on the highest-performance GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100 and A100) but also that smaller models would be able to be loaded onto consumer-grade hardware and still be able to perform well on inference tasks. Both of these tests passed successfully.\\n\\nThe testnet hosted some of the most widely recognized AI models and apps, including Stable Diffusion, LLaMA, Flan-T5, RedPajama, Falcon, and many others. These models represent a selection of the most powerful and capable AI models available today. Ensuring they are able to run efficiently on the network provides a glimpse into future production use cases of the Akash Supercloud. The complete list of all AI models and apps with pre-configured deployment specifications (specifically for Akash Network) can be found in [the Awesome-Akash repo](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash).\\n\\n**High-level testnet deployment stats:**\\n\\n- Total GPU deployment requests: 3,108\\n- Total amount of leases created (accepted bids): 2,463\\n- Total unique addresses that issued a GPU deployment request: 105\\n- Largest number of concurrently hosted GPUs: 80\\n\\nThe Overclock Labs team completed significant preparation before the launch of the testnet to ensure the basic deployment functionality worked as intended. The core of this work involved testing a selection of the leading AI models on NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs. An overview of this work, with screenshots of the individual deployments, can be found in this Twitter thread from Akash, which, as of today, has received more than 115,000 impressions.\\n\\nMany participants also documented the process of deploying AI models on Akash GPU providers. Here are [examples](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1677020245352132609?s=20) of people sharing their experiences and deployments on social media during the testnet.\\n\\n- [Deploying TerminalGPT](https://twitter.com/RybnikovYuriy/status/1676698463214485505?s=20) \u2014 @RybnikovYuriy\\n- [Deploying Alpaca.cpp](http://RybnikovYuriy) \u2014 @RybnikovYuriy\\n- [Setting up an Akash Provider](https://twitter.com/foobar4423/status/1675056235144699904?s=20) \u2014 @foobar4423\\n- [Setting up an NVIDIA 3090 as a testnet provider](https://twitter.com/kaylem_nft/status/1674427595180638208?s=20) \u2014 @kaylem_nft\\n- [Building a sentiment analysis app on Akash](https://twitter.com/clydedev_/status/1676004100176072705?s=20) \u2014 @clydedev\\\\_\\n- [Step-by-step walkthrough of setting up an Akash GPU provider with a single k3 cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kl9T_TEu7U)\\n\\nThe testnet also hosted [AIQRArt](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1678862324801871872?s=20), built by [zJ (an Akash Insider)](https://twitter.com/zJu_u). AIQRArt is an easy-to-use application for creating custom QR images using a fine-tuned version of Stable Diffusion. It also features an easy sign-in process that allows users to connect to the app with an Akash wallet address without signing up with an email address or password.\\n\\n### Creating Deployment Specifications (SDLs)\\n\\nAkash deployments require a specification file created in an Akash-specific format called the [Stack Definition Language (SDL)](https://akash.network/docs/readme/stack-definition-language). One of the key testnet tasks involved participants creating these deployment specifications, each of which has to be tailored to the unique deployment (in this case, AI models and applications).\\n\\nThe code below is an example of an SDL deployment file.\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: \\&quot;2.0\\&quot;\\n\\nservices:\\n  falcon7b:\\n    image: shimpa/falcon7b:0.07\\n    expose:\\n      - port: 8000\\n        as: 80\\n        to:\\n          - global: true\\n\\nprofiles:\\n  compute:\\n    falcon7b:\\n      resources:\\n        cpu:\\n          units: 8\\n        memory:\\n          size: 100Gi\\n        gpu:\\n          units: 1\\n          attributes:\\n            vendor:\\n              nvidia:\\n        storage:\\n          - size: 200Gi\\n  placement:\\n    akash:\\n      pricing:\\n        falcon7b:\\n          denom: uakt\\n          amount: 100000\\n\\ndeployment:\\n  falcon7b:\\n    akash:\\n      profile: falcon7b\\n      count: 1\\n```\\n\\nThe Akash community maintains a repository of all the [currently available pre-created SDLs](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash) called \u2018Awesome-Akash.\u2019 Currently, the repository contains 30+ categories and nearly 200 individual deployment specifications across a wide range of applications, AI models, and more. The entire repository and its files are fully open-source for anyone to reference and modify.\\n\\n### Benchmarking GPU Performance\\n\\nThe final main task was specifically geared toward GPU Providers. This task required those who set up and ran GPU providers to run a PyTorch SDL to benchmark the performance of their GPUs on Akash. These early benchmarking deployments created a set of results that are visualized below. As part of Akash\u2019s open-source ethos, the [entire dataset is publicly available for anyone to view and reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkJOpmDqa0nY8llpCt0k0F7N0y8I9hgC_1X5LyYJw4g/edit?usp=sharing).\\n\\nThe process of benchmarking GPUs on Akash is ongoing and will be actively encouraged even after the launch of the Akash GPU Mainnet upgrade is complete. Public benchmarking will help to ensure that performance is transparent and open, especially as the network evolves.\\n\\n![Testnet-Results](./testnet-results.png)\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nThe successful completion of the testnet provides a strong indication that the features tested will ensure the success of the Akash GPU Mainnet upgrade, which will make the GPU features from the testnet available to everyone. The network is expected to complete the upgrade later this month. As of today, the code is complete, which only leaves a final round of testing before the upgrade proposal is put on-chain, which will allow the Akash community and the general public to vote on the upgrade. Once this proposal passes, the block height for the upgrade will be set, and the Akash core team will begin coordinating with validators to ensure a smooth upgrade on the specified date and time.\\n\\nFollow [Akash on Twitter](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) for real-time updates on the Akash GPU Mainnet upgrade, the network, and the community.

More importantly, it threatens to concentrate the development of the most powerful AI models in the hands of a few corporations.\\n\\nThese corporations are often the only ones with the significant resources needed to acquire and operate these powerful GPUs, and they have rushed to capture and control the available supply.\\n\\nLarge cloud providers are no exception. Many of the largest cloud providers are strongly incentivized to focus on their largest customers, who are prioritized by their size and willingness to pay for expensive reserve instances \u2014 which involves committing to contracts that guarantee access to the most desirable GPUs. For everyone else, those GPUs are simply unavailable.\\n\\nThese incentives shape a market that often leaves many startups, researchers, and independent developers searching for compute.\\n\\n## Enter the AI Supercloud\\n\\nAkash introduced the world to an open-source marketplace for compute. Today, the network is taking the next significant step by launching a testnet for the first open-source marketplace for high-density GPUs \u2014 enabling anyone around the world to access a wide range of powerful GPUs for training, pre-processing, fine-tuning, and running inference.\\n\\nThe Overclock Labs team created and tested the first version of the Akash GPU Testnet. Now, the testnet is ready to bring in the community and the general public with over $100,000 of rewards for participants who complete tasks within four categories.\\n\\n### Set up a GPU provider\\n\\nAnyone, from independent developers to cloud providers, can set up a GPU Provider on the testnet. These providers will help ensure an adequate supply of compute resources to thoroughly stress-test the network, which is crucial for completing the other tasks.\\n\\nThe Akash GPU Testnet has already received interest from providers with NVIDIA H100s, A100s, and other leading datacenter and consumer GPU models.\\n\\n### Deploy AI models\\n\\nThe next phase of the testnet will involve deploying various AI models onto each GPU type. As these models have different capabilities and sizes, these tests will help match each GPU type against the deployments it is best suited to handle.\\n\\nFor example, running inference on a smaller language model is best suited for older datacenter models or a consumer-grade GPU. On the other hand, performing fine-tuning on a larger model would likely require the compute power only found in the most capable GPUs \u2014 like the NVIDIA H100 or A100.\\n\\n### Benchmark GPUs with PyTorch\\n\\nThis task will involve benchmarking the performance of each GPU type with PyTorch, a popular framework for machine learning.\\n\\nThis will give insight not only into the individual performance of each GPU type on Akash but also into the network's capabilities as a whole \u2014 which will be essential to communicate the value proposition of Akash to those who may be used to traditional centralized cloud providers.\\n\\n### Create SDLs (Deployment specifications)\\n\\nThe Stack Definition Language (SDL) is a configuration file format that standardizes how deployers request compute resources from providers on Akash.\\n\\nFor the Akash GPU Testnet, one of the four main tasks will involve participants creating new SDL files for many of the leading AI models, tools, and apps. These new SDLs will be added to the [Awesome-Akash](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash) repository, where Akash\u2019s most popular SDLs are gathered for use by the general public.\\n\\n## Join the Akash GPU Testnet\\n\\nTo learn more about each task, [read the complete overview for the Testnet](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/wg-gpu/GPU-AI-Incentivized-Testnet.md).

If you are in tech, you have to be living under a rock to not see that AI represents a generational shift in not just the way we will use products but also in the way all products are built and how businesses operate. As such, AI is opening new growth opportunities for all businesses, including those that I and the team &amp; open source community I work with (at akash.network), are focused on (decentralized cloud computing).\\n\\nBefore starting to work on our AI offering (at [Akash Network](https://akash.network/)) I spent a fair amount of time educating myself about the AI landscape, starting around the time that ChatGPT got announced. And boy, have I had a lot of catching up to do for the last 6 months (and still struggle to keep pace with developments, each week)!\\n\\nSo, I figured I may save you some of the time I spent reading countless articles, blog posts, press releases, trying new products and building some prototypes myself, by sharing some high level learnings.\\n\\n**Intended Audience**: This is not a beginners _\u201cwhat is AI?\u201d_ post or an super advanced _\u201chow does ControlNet modify the base stable diffusion model?\u201d_ or _\u201cwhat are different types of tokenization methods?\u201d_ type post, but somewhere in between. It is intended for people who have a general understanding of AI models and follow the \u201cbuzz\u201d but are looking for a cohesive understanding of the players, use cases and high level model development process.\\n\\n## New Generative AI Models every week\\n\\nOn average one new [Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) model was announced almost every week, thus far in 2023. Whether it be big announcements from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai), [Google](https://ai.google/) and [Meta](https://ai.facebook.com/), or less \u201cmainstream\u201d models like [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) (built through a collaboration between [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [StabilityAI](https://stability.ai/) and [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/)) or non mainstream products and models like [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet), [Palm-E](https://palm-e.github.io/) or [Conformer-1](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/).\\n\\nSome clear themes here:\\n\\n1. There are multiple competing versions of everything. Whether it be the base model (for example: [DALL-E-2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2), [Dreambooth](https://github.com/google/dreambooth), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/), and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) are all competing for the \u201ctext-to-image\u201d market, while Microsoft, Google and Notion are all competing for the \u201ctext analysis, suggestion, summarization\u2026\u201d market) or for services offered on top of a base model to make it easy to use (for example, both [StabilityAI](https://stability.ai/) and [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) are services built on top of the same open source stable diffusion model from [Compvis](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion))\\n2. For Text generation (and LLMs in general): GPT-4 from OpenAI is the undisputed king but Google\u2019s [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html) and Meta\u2019s [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) are popular open source options.\\n3. The rise of AI chat applications: Led by the viral success of ChatGPT (created by OpenAI), new competitors are emerging to capitalize on the growing demand for LLM-powered chat tools. Notably, Anthropic\u2019s [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude), a highly customizable competitor to ChatGPT and Bing Chat.\\n4. For image generation: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) seems to be in the lead for closed source models (even ahead of OpenAI\u2019s [DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is the most popular open source option. The contrast between the two is almost akin to the Apple/iOS and Android alternative.\\n5. [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) has become the defacto repository for AI/ML sharing and collaboration, aka the \u201cGithub for AI models and datasets.\u201d\\n\\n![Huggingface](./hugging-face-inline.png)\\n\\n## Race to the bottom with \u201cOpen AI API wrapped\u201d App clones\\n\\nOutside of a few of the big tech companies (MS, Google, Meta) who have their own Generative AI models and LLMs, most of the AI productivity applications being built today (copy.ai, jasper.ai, playground.ai and countless others) are essentially wrappers on top of Open AI\u2019s APIs. While they are seeing a lot of buzz, it is hard to imagine this continuing forever. While some of these will go on to generate 100s of millions of dollars in revenue, eventually this will be a race to the bottom for many of these startups and they will either consolidate or get acquired or just fade away. Most of the productivity AI applications will get integrated into existing bigger \u201ctraditional\u201d applications (MSWord, GDocs, Slack, Teams, Salesforce, Hubspot, Notion, Adobe, Autodesk, VSCode, Replit, Github etc).\\n\\nThe disruption to the above trend will only happen when one of the non-OpenAI models surpasses them in capabilities, efficiency, price and/ or functionality. This may happen from relatively unknown companies like Assembly.ai or from one of the big tech models (subsequent iterations/ generations of BERT, PaLM-E, LLaMA and others) or both.\\n\\nUsers may favor non-OpenAI models and services, if they prefer greater control as well. This definitely has similarities to the Apple (closed) + Android (open) ecosystem, both thriving alongside each other, in some ways.\\n\\nAnd to be clear, there are some very valid and lucrative cases for both text analysis (in productivity apps like MS O365, GSuite, Notion and others) as well as for image generation (in Adobe, Autodesk, Canva and others). Here is a quick run down of the use cases for AI image generation:\\n\\n1. **Avatar creation**: Applications like Avatar AI use text-to-image AI to generate custom avatars for users based on their textual descriptions of physical features, clothing, and accessories.\\n2. **Online shopping**: Some e-commerce websites use text-to-image AI to generate product images that show how items might look in different colors, styles, or settings based on user input.\\n3. **Gaming**: Video game developers use text-to-image AI to create game assets like characters, environments, and objects based on textual descriptions or scripts.\\n4. **Digital art**: Some artists use text-to-image AI to generate digital artwork based on written prompts, poetry, or other creative writing.\\n5. **Graphic design**: Text-to-image AI can be used by graphic designers to create custom graphics, logos, or illustrations based on textual descriptions of their clients' needs.\\n6. **Advertising**: Advertisers can use text-to-image AI to create compelling visual ads based on written ad copy or product descriptions.\\n7. **Virtual interior design**: Applications that generate realistic 3D environments based on textual descriptions can be used by interior designers or homeowners to visualize and plan room layouts and decor.\\n8. **Storytelling**: Writers or game developers can use text-to-image AI to generate visuals for their stories, games, or interactive narratives based on their written scripts or prompts.\\n\\nIf you are looking for more apps built on Open AI (and other models like Stable Diffusion) APIs, gpt3demo has a nicely sorted collection of more than 700 such apps, that seems fairly up to date.\\n\\n![GPT-3 Apps](./gpt-3-apps.png)\\n\\n## GPUs are the new oil (for tech)\\n\\nGPUs from Nvidia have been in high-demand for several months now, with demand showing no signs of slowing. The challenge is sourcing GPUs (like [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) and [H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/)) that can allow these applications to run at a level of performance that doesn\u2019t hurt user experience. This favors the big players who have either amassed a large inventory of GPUs or have the volume/ demand leverage to acquire them or are building their own tensor optimized hardware. It also puts Nvidia in a position of very strong leverage which it continues to try to cement by building it\u2019s own cloud/ service layer ([Nvidia DGX Cloud](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-dgx-cloud-giving-every-enterprise-instant-access-to-ai-supercomputer-from-a-browser)) that sits between the big clouds and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs.\\n\\nThere are 4 things that will upset this equation:\\n\\n1. **Alternatives to Nvidia Chips**: AMD, Intel &amp; Xilinx are eager to take marketshare from Nvidia, after having underestimated or not planned for the potential of Generative AI.\\n2. **Big cloud leverage**: The big cloud players recognize the vulnerable position they\u2019re in, with respect to Nvidia (who can dictate prices) and are making their custom silicon to reduce dependency (like Google TPUs and Amazon Graviton/ Inferentia/ Tranium). In addition, expect to see more partnerships between the big clouds and players in 1 above.\\n3. **Software Optimizations**: Meanwhile, software optimizations that let models run on lighter hardware, continue to emerge. Best example of this is Neuralmagic\u2019s Deepsparse technology (I\u2019ve verified running BERT using this on a 2 Core vCPU and it works great) and ports of facebook\u2019s LLaMA, like alpaca, that can be run on an M1 Mac or even a Raspberry Pi.\\n4. **Distributed GPU compute solutions**: These have the potential to offer an alternative where a bunch of lower end GPUs (and GPU clusters) can be used in the absence of one higher end one. Some examples of this are companies working on GPU-over-IP type solutions. While these may not be applicable to some of the generative AI applications today, there are definitely use cases for them.\\n\\nThe key thing to keep in mind is that the GPU market was already predicted to explode by 10x, even before these new generative AI models were invented. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anilmurty_parallelprogramming-gpu-cloud-activity-6984934072363995136-G5FB?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop) is a quick post I wrote 6 months ago, about what an \u201cEMBARRASSINGLY PARALLEL\u201d workload is and how it is the driving force behind the explosive growth of GPU usage, over the past decade.\\n\\n![GPT Market Size](./GPT-market-size.png)\\n\\n## Open Source is alive and well in AI/ML\\n\\nWhile the buzz around OpenAI (which to be clear is NOT open source, even though it originally started out that way) and its announcements overshadow everything else, it is becoming clear that Open Source isn\u2019t dead in AI/ML.\\n\\n1. All models released by Google (like [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert), [Dreambooth](https://github.com/google/dreambooth) and [PaLM](https://palm-e.github.io/)), Meta (LLaMa) and Compvision ([Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)) are open source.\\n2. There are several efforts to building open source tooling, that makes it easier to run models, provides auxiliary services like \u201cAPIs for generating embeddings\u201d and optimizes compute and memory requirements:\\n\\n   - Cog: Is a tool for containerizing ML models from Replicate. Even though replicate is technically a competitor of sorts, they indicate that they have no problem in others using this on their own infrastructure. I\u2019ve used this myself where I used this to containerize and run Stable Diffusion in GCP.\\n   - Chassis: Another product focused on making it easy to containerize ML Models + Data sets\\n   - Neural Magic\u2019s technology that enables AI models to run efficiently on CPUs is open source: https://github.com/neuralmagic\\n   - There are independent Open Source developers implementing open source versions models almost as fast as the commercial companies do (even for some models from OpenAI): https://github.com/lucidrains?tab=repositories\\n   - There are Open Source implementations for auxiliary functions, like \u201cEmbeddings-as-a-Service\u201d: https://github.com/amansrivastava17/embedding-as-service\\n\\n   I\u2019d love to hear from you if you have references to other open source projects for AI and ML.\\n\\n3. It also remains to be seen, whether other internet platforms (particularly open ones, or ones trying to be more open, like twitter), decide to play nice with Open AI or not:\\n\\n![Elon Musk tweet about OpenAI](./elon-musk-open-ai-tweet.png)\\n\\n## AI Workload Types\\n\\nTo help understand the stages in AI model training and use, here is a quick and simplified view. After a base model (like [generic BERT](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-2_H-128_A-2) or [Base Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)) has been developed (i.e. the model has been authored, neural network designed, implemented, data tokenized and trained with a base set of parameters), the following are the stages to using it in actual user applications :\\n\\n- Step1: Hyperparameter Search or Tuning\\n  - **Goal**: Finding the right set of parameters (like \u201clearning rate\u201d or \u201cneural network depth/ layers\u201d) for the base model you chose and the application you are building. The output is the set of parameters that you will take to step 2\\n  - **Process**: Run a small training data set through multiple parameter combinations. Then pick parameters that result in the most accurate output (lowest loss). Can take from a couple hours to a couple days to do this per model, depending on how powerful the GPUs are.\\n  - **Other Considerations**: Each of these parameter combinations can be run in parallel and there is no communication necessary between the GPUs running them - i.e \u201cEmbarrassingly Parallel\u201d problem. Therefore the HPC/ GPU cluster used for hyperparameter search does NOT require high bandwidth networking between the GPU servers.\\n  - **Infrastructure Requirements**: High End GPUs preferred (depending on how quickly you want the results and how many epochs/ runs you intend to perform). Availability and Uptime is nice-to-have but not mission critical (because this is not end user facing but just internal to the model/ app builder).\\n- Step2: Large-Scale Distributed Training\\n  - **Goal**: Training the model + parameters you have identified in Step1 so that it is ready to use in production (in an actual application) for inference (step 3)\\n  - **Process**: Typically will divide up the training data set into batches and train them in parallel (on the same model - the one you chose in step 1) so as to make it somewhat of an embarrassingly parallel problem.\\n  - **Other considerations**: There will be a lot of communication between the servers running these batches while the distributed training is happening (to feedback outputs of training runs to next run). So it is important to have a high speed communication between the GPU clusters/ providers.\\n  - **Infrastructure Requirements**: High End GPUs important to shorten training time. High bandwidth communication between GPU instances IS important. Availability and uptime again are nice to have but not mission critical.\\n- Step3: Production Inference\\n  - **Goal**: Deploy the model trained in step 2 in production (usually through a user facing product) and have it run predictions (infer things).\\n  - **Process**: Deploy the model you trained or pick a model trained by someone else and deploy it. This involves running the model and applying weights necessary to run predictions using the model.\\n  - **Other considerations**: In many cases, the users running production inference are not as sophisticated and technical when it comes to AI &amp; ML as those building and training the models. User experience that abstracts infrastructure complexity is important to gain adoption with this user base.\\n  - **Infrastructure Requirements**: Can get by with less-than-best GPUs but availability and uptime are critical (since this will be a service used by external users)\\n\\n## AI User Ecosystem\\n\\nThe ecosystem of products, companies and services that enable us to train, build and productize AI can be broken down as follows:\\n\\n- ### Model &amp; App Builders\\n\\n  This segment is further divided into 3 sub segments\\n\\n  - #### AI Model Creators:\\n    These are scientific groups and companies that have the deepest knowledge and expertise in AI and ML and are engaged in building and training the models that power the applications. Popular models include, Stable Diffusion from CompVis, Google\u2019s BERT, LaMDA &amp; AudioLM, Open AI\u2019s Whsiper, GPT and DALL-E, Meta\u2019s LLaMA, and more. In some cases, these companies and groups also produce the end-user application \u2013 as in the case of Google BARD and ChatGPT. In other cases the end user app is built by someone else \u2013 as in the case of Stable Diffusion or ControlNet. These users may be the authors of the model or initial (base) implementors or both. They are also running all 3 steps outlined in the previous section. In most cases, they will have access to their own infrastructure (and in many cases are a big cloud provider itself).\\n  - #### AI Model Tuners:\\n    These are users who take a base model and tweak it to improve it in some way to enable it to produce more accurate results. A good example of this is Stable Diffusion, which has two variants, one produced by StabilityAI and another produced by RunwayML. These users often don\u2019t invent the model themselves but rather take a paper/ proposal and implement it or take an existing implementation and tune it for a specific type of application. These users are NOT inventing the model but usually must run through all 3 stages outlined in the previous section.\\n  - #### Pure App Developers:\\n\\n    There are a multitude of applications across various Enterprise and Consumer segments that are being built by companies of all sizes (startup to fortune 100). All these applications, rely on a handful of pretrained models (like the ones above) but serve the following categories\\n\\n    - Text Summarization\\n    - Text-to-Speech conversion\\n    - Speech-to-Text conversion\\n    - Text Translation\\n    - Document Generation\\n    - Code Generation &amp; Summarization\\n    - Image Generation &amp; Editing\\n    - Video Generation &amp; Editing\\n    - Audio Generation &amp; Editing\\n    - Internet Search\\n\\n    These users are typically only running the inference stage of the 3 stages outlined before, because they are taking a pre-trained and tuned model and building a nice user experience on it. They are typically just doing the inference portion of it. In a way, each time you use ChatGPT, you are using one such application that is running inference (aka, making a prediction about what text you are expecting when you ask it a question).\\n\\n- AI Tool Builders:\\n  These are teams and companies that are building tools to make it easy to discover, package and deploy AI models and in some cases offer these as services. Examples include, **Cog and Chassis** (for containerizing ML models), **Huggingface** (for discovering, sharing, reusing, models and ML datasets - essentially the github for AI/ ML), **Replicate** and **Banana.dev** (Deploying+Running AI models) as well as full cycle platforms for training, deploying and managing ML models - like **DataRobot**, **NeptuneAI** and **VertaAI**.\\n- AI Infrastructure Providers:\\n  This is very core to all AI and ML development and advancement, regardless of what user segment or application is in question. This includes traditional public cloud providers, newer GPU focused providers (like Lamba Labs and Coreweave) as well as Traditional Datacenter and Cloud Hosting providers starting to offer GPUs.\\n\\n  [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) (that we are building, with a [small core team](https://ovrclk.com/) and [large open source community](https://github.com/akash-network/community)) is unique in this respect, in that it:\\n\\n  1. Is Decentralized (we don\u2019t own the infrastructure), in fact no one entity owns all of it.\\n  2. Is fully open source (all code on github: https://github.com/akash-network)\\n  3. Is open core and community driven: https://github.com/akash-network/community\\n  4. Is Peer-to-Peer (in theory anyone with a server can become an Akash provider, but most are small or medium, datacenter operators).\\n  5. Has access to a large pool of GPU resources, thanks to availability of GPU power from a large crypto mining community that has relied on Akash for compute for years. Here is an excerpt from an [article published by arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/the-end-of-ethereum-mining-could-be-a-bonanza-for-gpu-shoppers/) last year, that talks about this:\\n\\n  ![Arstechnica](./arstechica-screenshot.png)\\n\\nSami Kassab (analyst at Messari) has written extensively about this in his [latest report](https://messari.io/report/decentralizing-machine-learning?).\\n\\n![Sami Kassab](./sami-kassab-messari.png)\\n\\nLastly, we will be sharing more about our AI plans at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit and would love to chat with you in-person if you are attending or in the area!\\n\\n![Cerebral Valley AI Summit](./cerebral-valley-summit.png)\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about our offering, please sign up here [for early access](https://akt.fyi/3GiLw9F).\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Fast Evolving AI Landscape&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;It\u2019s barely 3 months into 2023 and it is clear that AI is going to dominate the tech space this year, and very likely this decade, by a wide margin (over Web3, Cloud, Mobile or anything else in the past couple decades).

It's now run by a network of globally distributed node operators who secure the Akash blockchain and provide cloud-grade server space for tenant applications.\\n\\nThe source code developed by Overclock Labs has been open since inception, and now we are taking the next step of opening up the process that produces it. Removing single failure points from one company makes Akash Network more resilient to institutional attack vectors.\\n\\nThe development of the Akash Network involves multiple steps that are managed by Overclock Labs. The process begins by determining user needs and creating technical specifications based on them. Once the specification is made, it is implemented by a developer and then released to the public. Afterward, validators vote to accept the new code and upgrade their systems with the latest version of Akash Node.\\n\\nThe process has functioned well so far, and Overclock achieved great success with shipping, two major mainnet upgrades that brought us [Persistent Storage](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-unlocks-persistent-storage-through-mainnet-3-upgrade/), and [IP Leasing](https://akash.network/blog/introducing-ip-leases-on-akash-network/).\\n\\nBut as the saying goes, \\&quot;If you want to go faster, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\\&quot; We believe that by opening up the process, we can achieve our goal of radical decentralization faster and further.\\n\\n> If you want to go faster, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\\n\\nAkash should utilize the strong developer community and open organization tools available to reach its potential. The Akash community is much larger than Overclock's employee pool. By allowing people to participate voluntarily, we can leverage their skills and values to help achieve the goal of executing our [product strategy](/development/product-strategy/).\\n\\nWe propose a set of [community groups](/development/current-groups/) inspired by successful projects like [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.dev/). These groups are open to anyone who wants to join, except for Committees that already have designated members.\\n\\n![Akash Community Groups Block Diagram](./akash-community-groups-block-diagram.png)\\n\\n#### Special Interest Groups (SIGs)\\n\\nSIGs are long-term groups that will be present for the project's duration. SIGs are dedicated teams working on specific parts of the Akash Network. They help to define and create products and features, as well as provide ongoing support for them.\\n\\n#### **Working Groups (WGs)**\\n\\nWorking Groups (WGs) are community groups that collaborate on large-scale initiatives that involve multiple Special Interest Groups (SIGs). They do not develop or create projects but rather define major projects with aspects across the whole system, potentially involving external partners and relevant parties. A Working Group may operate for a short time rather than being a permanent group like SIGs.\\n\\n#### **User Groups (UGs)**\\n\\nUGs help people communicate openly, find topics that can become WGs or SIGs, discuss broad use cases (like ML/AI or Big Data), and discuss ideas we don't prioritize for product development according to the current strategy.\\n\\n#### **Committees**\\n\\nA committee is a designated group of people who discuss sensitive topics. They are expected to be transparent in their work, but there may be some circumstances where private conversations are necessary. Some examples of committees include the Steering Committee and special committees such as 'security' or 'code of conduct.'\\n\\n##### **Steering Committee**\\n\\nRegular meetings help the Akash Network community operate more efficiently. If needed, it also resolves conflicts. The Steering Committee is a particular SIG that evaluates projects, prioritizes, and assigns them to the proper SIG or WG.\\n\\n### Whats Next?\\n\\n#### New Website \u2728\\n\\nWe're super excited to launch and open-source the completely rebuilt Akash [website](https://akash.network). The source code and all its content are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/akash-network/website) for anyone to contribute. Browse through and suggest a feature or report a bug.\\n\\nThe new website allows people to quickly post content that was created by the community. It has a modern design which makes it easier to navigate and read.\\n\\n#### New GitHub Home \ud83c\udfe1\\n\\nWe also migrated key repositories from [ovrclk](https://github.com/ovrclk) GitHub organization to [akash-network](https://github.com/akash-network) organization. The new organization will be the home of all Akash Network-related repositories. The migration is still in progress, and we will update the list as we move more repositories.\\n\\n#### Kick Off \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nOur new working model is already underway, and we have already had several successful [WG meetings](https://github.com/akash-network/community/tree/main/wg-content-moderation) with the Akash Community and ecosystem partners.\\n\\nThe first Steering Committee meeting is scheduled for January 26th, 2023. In the meantime, browse Akash's [GitHub](https://github.com/akash-network/community) to learn about the various SIGs and WGs that are currently active \u2014 and head over to our Discord to join the conversation.\\n\\n#### How can you contribute?\\n\\n_If you are a ..._\\n\\n- **Technical Operator (non-programmer) that never used Akash:** Review the [documentation](https://akash.network/docs/) for Akash and attempt to deploy a Tetris game.

Web3 creates many technologies that will enable privacy and thus is at the forefront of these debates.\\n\\n- Many centralized entities in web3 have structural failures starting to surface.\\n- Consensys recently changed its privacy policy, allowing them to surveil transactions and collect IP addresses.\\n- Even though their intent is not malicious, exposing privacy in this way is fundamentally dangerous. There is always a risk of that info being exposed. Centralization comes with a certain set of risks.\\n- Web3 enables people to create code that _cannot_ collect information.\\n- For example, Akash _cannot_ collect IPs or impose censorship&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;as it is a public blockchain.\\n\\n## Overclock Console will provide easy access to web3\\n\\n[See what the Overclock Console UI looks like here.](https://twitter.com/gregosuri/status/1595627377081864192?s=20&amp;t=upUL3Z6m_xXM6q928I-grA)\\n\\nWith the upcoming public beta of Overclock Console almost here, web3 will have a way to access the decentralized cloud in a way that is easy, intuitive, and web-based.\\n\\n- If you want to be among the first to use Overclock Console, join the [Akash Community](https://akash.network/community).\\n- The private beta is currently live, and the product is working well.\\n- \u201cDecentralized tools are difficult to use\u201d is a common complaint&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;but Overclock Console will help to mitigate these concerns.\\n\\n## Cloudmos launched a new Alerts-based Twitter bot\\n\\n- With Cloudmos\u2019 new Alerts tool, users can monitor wallet balances and governance alerts (including reminders to vote on proposals, and more).\\n- Using Alerts, [Cloudmos built a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cloudmosio/status/1598725295607005191?s=20&amp;t=upUL3Z6m_xXM6q928I-grA) that tracks major token movements across three chains: Akash Network, Cosmos, and Juno.\\n- [Check out the details here.](https://twitter.com/cloudmosio/status/1598725295607005191?s=20&amp;t=adBbZwqV-pcW0RFq8J-1sw)\\n\\n## Akash ecosystem updates\\n\\n**Luna continues building Akash\u2019s Terraform Provider**\\n\\nAkash Insider [Luna](https://twitter.com/luna_4_go) continues development on Akash\u2019s [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Provider, which the Overclock Labs team also uses internally.\\n\\n- This provider works well if you have existing investments in automation (80% of the cloud uses Terraform).\\n- This tool gives Akash the ability to plug into that ecosystem with minimal behavioral change.\\n- Greg Osuri (Founder &amp; CEO of Overclock Labs) has already started contributing code to the Terraform provider on Github.\\n\\n[**Moonbys**](https://twitter.com/moonbys_) **is moving to Akash Network**\\n\\n- [Check out the Moonbys project here](https://twitter.com/moonbys_).\\n\\n## Our guest this week: Web3 Working Group\\n\\n[**Amy James**](https://twitter.com/AmyofAlexandria)\\n\\nCo-Executive Director, Web3 Working Group\\n\\nAmy James is the Co-Executive Director of [Web3 Working Group](https://web3wg.org/), a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization providing education about how web3 infrastructure will decentralize the web and permanently restore user control of cyberspace. She\u2019s also the co-founder of Open Index Protocol, an index for all public information built with blockchain and other decentralized technology, and used by Caltech, Overstock subsidiary Medici Land Governance, the State of Wyoming, MENA\u2019s largest independent news platform, Streambed Media &amp; many others.

Still, many people aren\u2019t sure how the regulation should be written.\\n- This is a critical juncture, and we must make sure that any new regulation considers the many different kinds of applications and types of infrastructure.\\n- Regulation should _not_ only be focused on DeFi and NFTs.\\n- There is an entire sector of the industry that is focused on core infrastructure, and that part of the industry shouldn\u2019t be regulated like a financial product.\\n- In doing so, we must ensure that there is a clear decoupling of finance and infrastructure&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;so that regulation can be drafted that will not cause unintended consequences.\\n\\n### Drafting intelligent regulation\\n\\n- A company or protocol\u2019s use case must be considered when future regulation is drafted.\\n- There needs to be space for machine-to-machine transactions, which might happen behind the scenes.\\n- Decentralized applications might not have a token connected to the application, but protocols might be used to transfer tokens behind the scenes. These protocols and token transfers must be allowed without onerous regulation.\\n- Unpredictable enforcement has held back the industry in many ways and has possibly hindered its development in the U.S.\\n- There is historical precedence for poorly-drafted regulations fundamentally altering the course of a country\u2019s economic history. See: the [Locomotive Acts (or Red Flag Acts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_Acts) in the UK, which unintentionally shifted most automobile production to Germany.\\n\\n### The rise of web3 infrastructure\\n\\n- Web3 infrastructure has the potential to impact the average person\u2019s daily life much more than the financial services side of web3, given how current internet infrastructure support many of the apps and services we use every day.\\n- Web3 infrastructure allows the internet to fulfill its original vision as a fully decentralized network. Much of web2 was a diversion from this original vision and led to massive centralization.\\n- For many web2 companies, there are incentives in play that lead to outcomes that are not optimal for users&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;even if the people working at those companies have good intentions.\\n- Web3 is a revolution that is on par with the printing press. Understanding this sets the tone for how we should think about web3 as a new generation of the internet.\\n- \u201cInfrastructure is the foundation of prosperity\u201d \u2014 Amy James\\n\\n### Web3 is good for business\\n\\n- We are reaching a point where we can make a case for the fundamental importance of web3.\\n- Web3 can no longer be regarded as trivial as more projects and protocols emerge and as Web2 companies begin adopting web3 technologies.\\n\\n[Listen to the final 30 minutes of the conversation (along with everything covered already) here.](https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1597977210341961728?s=20&amp;t=uSg6brBdtetQM2WlSvTPIQ)\\n\\n---\\n\\n[Subscribe to Akash Network's newsletter here](https://akashnetwork.substack.com/).\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly: Web3 Working Group&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The battle of privacy vs. surveillance&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-12-02T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;],[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.DPOnAhtf.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-weekly-web3-working-group/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;overclock-labs-november-2022-recap/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;overclock-labs-november-2022-recap&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAs we close out November, here is a recap of the past month for Overclock Labs and Akash Network.\\n\\nAkash Network successfully completed the upgrade to Mainnet 4\\n\\nOn November 17th, Akash Network completed the upgrade to Mainnet 4.

IP Leases are supported in version [**0.18.0** of the Akash CLI](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/akash-v0.18.0-cli-release-notes) and are also available for use via the [Cloudmos deploy tool](https://cloudmos.io/). The on-chain code changes to support IP Leases were already released as part of the recent Akash Network [Mainnet 4 upgrade](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/27), so this feature is ready to use right now.\\n\\n## Why We Built It\\n\\nAs Akash Network has gained popularity among Web3 developers, we have been listening closely to feedback and prioritizing things that make it easier for them to manage and scale applications and workloads on a decentralized cloud. While Web3 applications have many differences from \u201ctraditional\u201d Web2 applications, they also have a lot in common when it comes to their underlying infrastructure needs. So it was no surprise that one of the most highly requested features from our community and customers was one that we take for granted when deploying services on existing cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, and GCP) \u2014 the ability to have a public, reserved Internet routable IP address assigned to a service running on public cloud infrastructure. IP Leases are also a key piece of our broader product strategy as we move into the \u201cparity\u201d (with respect to Web2) phase, as [highlighted by Greg in a tweet](https://twitter.com/gregosuri/status/1587858044108488705) recently:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1669215218-screen-shot-2022-11-23-at-9-53-27-am.png)\\n\\nWhile Akash users have had ways to expose endpoints of their services, using HTTP endpoints connected to ports provided by Kubernetes \u2014 they had no control over the ports. Further, some services (like a VPN, for example) must use standard ports in the 0-1024 range, which isn\u2019t possible unless you have a dedicated IP address. The ability to lease a dedicated IP address removes these limitations and broadens the types of applications that can be deployed on Akash Network.\\n\\n## For Tenants (Developers &amp; Other Users)\\n\\nUsers deploying workloads on Akash now have the option to request a public IPv4 address as part of their deployments. Users needing dedicated IP addresses for their applications and services specify that in their bid request and submit it to the Akash marketplace. Providers that have dedicated IP address pools configured to respond to the request, and the user is able to pick one of the providers to deploy their service on. Once deployed, the user gets an IP address in addition to an HTTP endpoint, either of which can be used to access the service publicly:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1669215272-screen-shot-2022-11-23-at-9-54-17-am.png)\\n\\n_(\u201cUser 03\u201d here wants a dedicated IP address, and \u201cProvider 02\u201d has this capability available)_\\n\\nIP addresses are a new _kind_ of _endpoint_ and can be requested when declaring each service in a deployment (in the SDL). Each declaration returns one single IPv4 address that may be bound to one or more ports in the standard (0-65535) range.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1669215359-screen-shot-2022-11-23-at-9-55-49-am.png)\\n\\n- Users only need to lease one public IPv4 address for all the services included in their deployment as long as they use a unique port for each of the services.\\n- The leased IP address is only reserved for the time that the lease is open with the specific provider unless explicitly migrated to a new lease.\\n- Leased IP addresses are retained when deployments are updated.\\n\\nHere is an example of an Akash SDL file and the resulting lease, showing the IP address allocated to the service for which the IP address was requested\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1669215407-screen-shot-2022-11-23-at-9-56-36-am.png)\\n\\nTo see a full detailed explanation of how to use IP Leases, check out our [documentation](https://akash.network/docs/features/ip-leases).\\n\\n## For Providers\\n\\nCurrent and new providers on Akash Network can use the new IP Lease functionality starting today, offering their users more value and increasing revenue by monetizing their unused IP space. Providers interested in making IP Leases available to their users have a set of steps to perform:\\n\\n1.  Decide on the pool of IP addresses you wish to make available. If you are running in a colocation facility, you would lease this pool from your hosting provider.\\n2.  Associate those IP addresses with a node on your Kubernetes cluster. This is the pool of IP addresses that will be available for lease.\\n3.  Install and configure a [Metal LB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) instance to work with your Kubernetes cluster. This is a load balancer that will take care of assigning and unassigning IP addresses from your pool to services as they come and go.\\n4.  Define a Kubernetes Service that makes the monitoring endpoints (APIs) of the Metal LB instance accessible to Akash services.\\n5.  Add Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) declaring the IP addresses available.\\n\\n## Digging Deeper\\n\\nWe would love it if you used IP Leases in your next deployment. To get you going smoothly, we have updated our [documentation](https://akash.network/docs/features/ip-leases) to cover all technical details. If you are curious about the high-level details of how we implement this feature, stay tuned for an upcoming technical blog post outlining how we use [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) and [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) under the hood to make IP Leases possible.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing IP Leases on Akash Network&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Overclock Labs, the parent company of Akash Network which is developing tools, protocols, and infrastructure that support the evolution and adoption of Web3, is excited to announce the general availability of \u201cIP Leases\u201d on Akash Network.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Anil Murty&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.DSdyMEzT.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1500],&quot;height&quot;:[0,844],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/introducing-ip-leases-on-akash-network/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;week-in-review-with-greg-osuri-nov-14th-nov-18th-2022/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;week-in-review-with-greg-osuri-nov-14th-nov-18th-2022&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nThis weekly recap series covers the ecosystem updates you\u2019re used to hearing in our Akash Weekly Twitter Spaces in around 500 words.

The token price directly correlates to the network's security, so Akash should incentivize token holders.

Today, you get an HTTP endpoint connected to your service, and Kubernetes assigns the actual port. With IP Leases, a tenant on Akash can request a dedicated IPV4 address, allowing users to assign a specific port instead of a randomly assigned port.\\n2.  **Provider Services Split**  \\n    This feature will separate parts of the behind-the-scenes development process for Overclock Labs and make it easier to iterate quickly and efficiently.\\n3.  **Cosmos IBC3**  \\n    IBC3 allows one chain to send transactions to another chain. This gives users access to the latest IBC Cosmos features and opens Akash Network to the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem.\\n4.  **Interchain Accounts (ICA)**  \\n    By enabling Interchain Accounts, we will provide access to interchain composability and significantly improve the user experience on Akash Network.\\n\\n## Mainnet 4 upgrade resources\\n\\nAkash Network's documentation: [https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs)\\n\\nAkash v0.18.0 CLI Release Notes: [https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/akash-v0.18.0-cli-release-notes](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/akash-v0.18.0-cli-release-notes)\\n\\nAkash Mainnet 4 Node Upgrade Guide: [https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/akash-mainnet4-node-upgrade-guide](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/akash-mainnet4-node-upgrade-guide)\\n\\nAkash Provider Upgrade: [https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/provider-upgrade](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/provider-upgrade)\\n\\nAkash Provider Enablement for **IP Leases**: [https://akash.network/docs/other-resources/experimental/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/ip-leases-provider-enablement-optional-step](https://akash.network/docs/other-resources/experimental/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/ip-leases-provider-enablement-optional-step)\\n\\n## Follow the Mainnet 4 upgrade in real-time\\n\\nHead over to [Akash Network's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/akash) and jump into the conversation on the **#general-chat** channel to connect with the Akash Community.\\n\\nToday, we'll be focused on real-time updates and discussions around the Mainnet 4 upgrade.

In the [first post](https://akash.network/blog/building-the-open-cloud-part-one), we discussed the current state of web3 infrastructure and a few of its challenges. We followed that up with a [second post](https://akash.network/blog/building-the-open-cloud-part-2-re-imagining-the-cloud-with-akash) outlining how Akash\u2019s decentralized open cloud solves these challenges. In the process, Akash is creating a platform for a thriving ecosystem of developer-focused products, tools, and services. This post will highlight Akash Network\u2019s growing and thriving ecosystem.\\n\\n## What is a Software Ecosystem?\\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with the term \u201cecosystem\u201d in the context of software services, here is a quick primer. It originates from the definition used in biology: a physical geographic area where organisms (plants and animals) as well as the weather and landscape, work together to form a \u201cbubble of life.\u201d Much the same, a software ecosystem is a virtual abstraction of space where various digital players work together to create a world of services for users in a common market.\\n\\nArguably, the best example of a software ecosystem today is the one created by Apple, which includes their software and hardware, as well as products and services built by third parties like iOS app developers and hardware accessory manufacturers. Apple\u2019s ecosystem stands in contrast to the Android ecosystem, which is more open. A third party can develop a phone which runs the Android operating system, even though Google also makes its own phones, like the Pixel. Given the open nature of Akash\u2019s software platform \u2014 Akash Network is comparable to the Android ecosystem.\\n\\n## The Akash Network Ecosystem\\n\\nAkash\u2019s ecosystem evolves organically as people discover the power of the platform and find new use cases that even we (the core team at Overclock Labs) have not thought about. We\u2019ve seen projects fall into two categories:\\n\\n1.  Ecosystem projects that build products, tools, and services that make it easier for others to use Akash Network.\\n2.  Projects that run some part of their product or service (website, nodes, and core infrastructure) on Akash.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1667500750-61-1.png)\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at a few of these projects in more detail.\\n\\n### Praetor App\\n\\nBesides all the benefits to the user that we outlined in the [previous post](https://akash.network/blog/building-the-open-cloud-part-2-re-imagining-the-cloud-with-akash), Akash Network also enables any data center operator today (or in theory, any person with compute and storage capacity) to become a provider on Akash Network. This is one way for existing data center operators to monetize their unused capacity. When Akash launched, the Overclock Labs team built a [CLI-based process](https://akash.network/docs/providers/build-a-cloud-provider) for setting up an Akash provider on a group of servers. While this was great for those with a technical background, it prevented less technical people from being able to \u201cjoin the open cloud revolution\u201d by becoming a provider. This is where Praetor App saw an opportunity and decided to build a solution.\\n\\nPraetor App is web-based product that significantly reduces the technical complexity of setting up a new provider on Akash. [Praetor is now called Akash provider console](https://provider-console.akash.network/). Akash provider console also includes a [provider profitability calculator](https://akash.network/pricing/provider-calculator/) and [usage pricing calculator](https://akash.network/pricing/usage-calculator/) as well as a provider status dashboard that shows the location, count, capacity, and uptime of the (~50 and growing) providers on Akash Network.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1667500819-screen-shot-2022-11-03-at-2-39-58-pm.png)\\n\\n### Cloudmos\\n\\nSimilar to the way that Praetor enables the growth of providers, [Cloudmos](https://cloudmos.io/) enables less technical users to deploy on Akash by providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), as an alternative to Overclock\u2019s CLI method.\\n\\nCloudmos includes a downloadable (win/exe and mac/dmg images available [here](https://github.com/maxmaxlabs/cloudmos-deploy/releases)) application, as well as a beta web-based UI for deploying an application. They have also built a very cool pricing comparison tool [https://cloudmos.io/price-compare](https://cloudmos.io/price-compare) that compares the price of compute resources on Akash with those on the three major public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1667500882-screen-shot-2022-11-03-at-2-41-12-pm.png)\\n\\n### Terraform Provider for Akash (by Luna, an Akash Insider)\\n\\n[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is one the most popular infrastructure automation tools used by DevOps teams that operate public cloud infrastructure. The way Terraform automates infrastructure provisioning is through the use of \u201cproviders\u201d. Put simply, a \u201cTerraform Provider\u201d is like a \u201cplugin\u201d that lets you work with public APIs provided by cloud service providers, SaaS providers, and other services used by a development team. Given the popularity of Terraform among developers and operations engineers, we were excited to see someone from the Akash community take it upon themselves to build a Terraform provider for Akash. The provider is located at the official Hashicorp Terraform registry docs [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloud-j-luna/akash/latest/docs). Detailed instructions on how to use it can be found in the Akash Network docs [here](https://akash.network/docs/other-resources/experimental/akash-deployments-via-terraform).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1667504595-screen-shot-2022-11-03-at-3-43-06-pm.png)\\n\\n### Moultrie Audits\\n\\nA key part of Akash Network\u2019s value comes from the diversity of its providers. While this is an advantage, it also creates a challenge because we have to ensure that the providers are who they claim to be and the services they claim to provide (amount of compute resources, reliability, security) are accurately represented. While the Akash core team (Overclock Labs) has a process for auditing providers before they are allowed onto the network, a critical part of scaling Akash Network is to have additional auditors. This is where [Moultrie Audits](https://www.moultrieaudits.com/) fulfills an important role. They perform checks on all Akash providers when they join, as well as on a regular basis, to ensure the providers are accurately representing themselves on the Akash Network marketplace.\\n\\n### Vixello\\n\\nVixello are builders and recently joined as validators within the Akash ecosystem. Vixello is focused on building tools that accelerate the adoption of web3, by bridging the gap for those coming from web2.\\n\\nThe Vixello team is increasingly active within the Akash ecosystem.

Greg Osuri will be speaking, and we\u2019ll give an update on the exact date and time when it\u2019s available. If you haven\u2019t gotten your tickets yet \u2014 use code FREN30 at decentralcon.com for 30% off.\\n\\n## Moultrie Audits places first at the DoD\u2019s BRAVO Hackathon\\nOur first guest this week was Anthony Rosa, Project Lead at Moultrie Audits \u2014 which is the auditing arm of Moultrie Cryptography. Moultrie Audits focuses on Akash Network, auditing providers to give users more information and help open the network to organizations and industries with stringent security requirements.\\n\\nMoultrie Audits build smart contracts for funds, crypto companies, grants, and for the government. They currently have active projects in all of these categories.\\n\\n### The history of the BRAVO Hackathon\\nThe BRAVO Hackathon, created by Stuart Wagner (chief digital transformation officer for the Department of the Air Force), takes its name from Project B \u2014 a \u201c1921 series of joint Army-Navy target exercises conducted on surplus ships in response to Army Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell\u2019s claim that bombers sink battleships.\u201d\\n\\n> \u201cStyled off Project B, BRAVO hackathons are sponsored by senior DoD leaders to provide technical and cultural innovation environments that enable government and industry to test and validate bold ideas on real DoD data. These events align under Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ. Brown, Jr.\u2019s Sept. 17, 2021, memo requiring senior leaders to enable Airmen to experiment and innovate.\u201d\\n- \\&quot;Introducing BRAVO: A hackathon series for Air Force, industry\\&quot;\\n\\n### BRAVO 1\\nAccording to Wagner, the BRAVO 1 hackathon was likely the largest and most complex data and software innovation event in the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s history.\\n\\nThere were a total of 16 judges, including dozens of guests from the DoD, and the final presentation was made to a three-star general.\\n\\n### Why Moultrie chose Secret Network and Akash Network for their project\\nAlthough many of the specifics of the application are unable to be disclosed for security reasons, Rosa was able to give a high-level overview of the intent of the application.\\n\\nMoultrie sought to build an application that allowed for the secure transfer of information within the government, preventing the accumulation of troves of inaccessible data \u2014 which has to be analyzed at some point in the future.\\n\\nBoth networks were chosen for being best-in-class for their respective solutions. Secret Network was selected as the best solution for keeping data private on-chain.\\n\\nAkash Network was chosen as the best solution for allowing the government to access information within its system without requiring more information than a wallet address.\\n\\n### Placing First in BRAVO 1\\nMoultrie\u2019s application won first place in the category \u201cMost Tactically Relevant for Maintenance Data.\u201d\\n\\nIt placed second for \u201cMost Tactically Relevant for Cyber Operations.\u201d\\n\\nThere is full intent to move this project to the NSA to continue development and make it operational. Moultrie is currently in negotiations around the process of transferring the application for further development.\\n\\n### Decentralization needs privacy. Privacy needs decentralization.\\nTor Bair is the Founder of Secret Foundation. Secret Network is the only layer-1 blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts live on mainnet, which expands on the idea of transactional privacy.\\n\\nSecret Network exists to support both privacy and decentralization, as both are core to the mission of the network. Bair notes that one is not possible without the other.\\n\\n> \u201cAs much of the stack needs to be as decentralized as possible.\u201d\\n\u2014 Tor Bair\\n\\n### Building at every level of the stack\\nSecret Network\u2019s expertise is around building privacy solutions. Learn more about Secret\u2019s roadmap here.\\n\\nOnce combined with solutions like Akash Network, we will start to see the full decentralized stack needed to build a fully private, decentralized web3.\\n\\n> \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be a part of the small coalition of blockchain builders that are building things that are truly globally useful and not just built for speculation.\u201d\\n\u2014 Tor Bair\\n\\n## Q&amp;A\\nQ: Are there plans for the U.S. government to run providers on Akash?\\nA: Rosa notes that although he can only speak for very specific parts of the DoD, he does believe that it is the intent of specific departments within the DoD to run providers at some point in the future.\\n\\nQ: What are the biggest challenges in building web3 solutions for governments?\\nA: (Rosa) The best thing that companies in the web3 space can do is have someone within the company familiar with the government processes needed to get approval. It also helps to have people within the government familiar with the project or company.\\n\\nQ: (For Greg Osuri) What are your thoughts on Aptos?\\nA: Greg notes that there is a lot of hype around the network and that there may be overlap in the future around running Aptos nodes on Akash. We\u2019ll keep an eye on Aptos going forward.\\n\\n[Listen to the full recording of this week\u2019s Akash Weekly Twitter Spaces](https://youtu.be/dJKFr9wAYwA_).\\n\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly: Secret Network and Moultrie Audits&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Welcome to another Akash Weekly from the team at Overclock Labs.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CWMgf8Ck.jpeg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;orientation&quot;:[0,1],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-weekly-secret-network-and-moultrie-audits/banner-image.jpeg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;building-the-open-cloud-part-2-re-imagining-the-cloud-with-akash/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;building-the-open-cloud-part-2-re-imagining-the-cloud-with-akash&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nThis is the second entry in our&nbsp;[four-part blog series](https://akash.network/blog/building-the-open-cloud-part-one). In this post, we build on our summary from Part 1, which focused on the key challenges in web3 infrastructure today. If you prefer to watch a presentation of this, you can find the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGqZzNWQrNs).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775012-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-16-49-pm.png)\\n\\nBefore we dig in and talk about how Akash Network addresses these challenges, let's start with a refresher on how public clouds work today.\\n\\n## The Status Quo for Public Cloud Infrastructure\\n\\nAny public cloud today \u2014 AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, Tencent, Oracle, Digital Ocean, or any of the smaller players in the space \u2014 is structured around the idea of a single large entity (like Amazon, in the case of AWS or Microsoft in case of Azure) owning all the infrastructure. All users (thousands, if not millions) connect to that infrastructure through the interfaces that the cloud provider exposes.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775180-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-19-38-pm.png)\\n\\nThe model above revolutionized the software industry. It enabled people to get started without the need to spin up and manage their own infrastructure. It lowered significant capital expenditure (CapEx) for small startups. The programmability of clouds also enabled things like elastic autoscaling and supported DevOps principles. The programmability of cloud infrastructure allows development teams to move faster by managing the infrastructure their applications run on without being dependent on operations teams. Their autoscaling nature also allows companies to keep costs low by fluidly scaling in response to demand.\\n\\nWhile the things above have contributed immensely to the pace of innovation across many industries, they have some drawbacks.\\n\\n- The cloud provider sets the price and you take it or leave it.\\n- The cloud provider decides where their infrastructure will be located. So, if they choose not to have a presence in your country or region, users of your application are forced to connect to a less-than-optimal location from a latency perspective.\\n- If one cloud service provider offers a better service for one thing (say, compute) and another offers a better service for something else (say, storage), it is hard if not impossible to use \u201cthe best of breed\u201d for your application.\\n- The current model does nothing to address the underutilized infrastructure in the 7M+ datacenters around the world.\\n- The user experience for deploying on a given cloud provider is, for the most part, decided by that cloud provider.\\n\\n## A Decentralized Vision\\n\\nImagine a decentralized version of a public cloud that addresses these concerns. It would look something like this:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775229-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-20-16-pm.png)\\n\\nInstead of a single, large entity owning and controlling all the infrastructure, you would have several smaller entities owning portions of the infrastructure. Users could choose which provider they want to run on \u2014 and if they choose, they could run on more than one provider.\\n\\nWhile this solves some of the problems we outlined earlier, it introduces new ones. The users in this scenario are now faced with the daunting task of figuring out contractual agreements with multiple providers, each of which could be for different lengths of time. Assuming they figure that out, they would then have to figure out how to deploy to each of these providers, which may have different interfaces and feature sets. All this would take an army of legal, operations, and engineering talent \u2014 making the task unrealistic for a small company.\\n\\nThis is where Overclock Labs saw an opportunity and decided to build a solution.\\n\\n## The Akash Network Approach\\n\\nOverclock Labs pioneered a two-sided marketplace for cloud compute where \u201cTenants\u201d lease compute resources from \u201cProviders\u201d to deploy their applications and services. Akash Network\u2019s marketplace for cloud compute is a software abstraction layer that provides a consistent experience for users regardless of which provider they choose for their deployment.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775298-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-21-36-pm.png)\\n\\nThere are clear benefits to this approach:\\n\\n1.  Each provider sets its own price.\\n2.  The tenant has greater freedom of choice for their deployment. If they are willing to sacrifice reliability for lower costs, the decision to make that tradeoff is left to the user.\\n3.  If a provider chooses to drop a tenant\u2019s application or service for arbitrary reasons, the tenant has greater optionality to avoid serious downtime.\\n4.  This model allows the underutilized capacity in the 7M+ datacenters to be brought to market, making it more environmentally sustainable.\\n5.  As the network grows, the user\u2019s options for geographic locations scale non-linearly, so their application achieves lower (read: better) latency and response times.\\n\\nIn addition, Akash is an open-source, community-driven network that is powered by a blockchain. This means that it adheres to a governance model that has been proven by many other open source projects and other blockchains.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775331-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-22-09-pm.png)\\n\\n## Akash Network \u201cUnder the Hood\u201d\\n\\nIf the above has you excited to learn more, here is a quick overview of how Akash Network works.\\n\\nAkash is built on Open Source Software (OSS). The two major technologies that Akash uses are [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Docker is the world's most widely used container technology and Kubernetes is the world\u2019s most popular container orchestrator.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775391-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-23-08-pm.png)\\n\\nProviders on Akash Network run [Kubernetes clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/) and Tenants (users of Akash Network) deploy their applications as Docker containers onto these Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\nA typical deployment workflow on Akash looks like the block diagram below:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775430-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-23-44-pm.png)\\n\\nTenants begin by containerizing their application into a docker image so it is portable (can be easily moved between providers). Then, they include a reference to that image in an SDL file. SDL stands for \u201cStack Definition Language\u201d and, as the name suggests, is a way for users to specify which infrastructure stack they would like for their application. The SDL file includes compute needs, locations, and pricing.\\n\\nOnce as SDL file is prepared, it is submitted to the Akash marketplace as a _\u201crequest for bids\u201d_. Akash software takes the information contained in the SDL file and broadcasts it to all the providers on the Akash marketplace (more than 50 at the time of writing). The providers inspect the request and decide if it is something that they can satisfy. If a provider decides that it can satisfy the request \u2014 it responds with a bid.\\n\\nThe tenant ends up with a set of bids from the providers that respond. The number of bids can range from a few to a few dozen, depending on the request. Then, the tenant decides which bid suits their needs. They may decide to choose a lower-cost provider, even if that provider lacks features. Once the user selects a provider and instructs Akash to deploy, the application container is scheduled to run on the provider and, within a few minutes, the application is deployed and running.\\n\\nTo summarize, it is a simple, four-step process:\\n\\n1.  Create SDL File \ud83d\udcc1\\n2.  Request a bid \ud83d\udcb2\\n3.  Choose a provider \ud83e\udd1d\\n4.  Deploy! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nIn case you are wondering what an SDL file looks like, here is an example of one that is used to spin up a Tetris game on the web. Let\u2019s break it down and understand the various parts.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1665775495-screen-shot-2022-10-14-at-3-24-52-pm.png)\\n\\nThe SDL file answers five questions to help Akash decide which provider to choose and how to deploy the app:\\n\\n1.  **Which app(s) or service(s) would you like to run?** In this case, it is a version of the game, Tetris, as indicated by the \\\\`image:bsodr/tetris\\\\` reference \u2014 which points to a publicly available docker image located [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bsord/tetris/tags).\\n2.  **What infrastructure resources do you need to run the deployment?** This is where you indicate the required amount of CPU, memory, and storage.\\n3.  **Where (location or provider specifics) would you like to run it?** This tells Akash if you have a preference for certain audited attributes (more on auditors in our forthcoming ecosystem post) or locations for the provider.\\n4.  **How much are you willing to pay the provider to host the deployment?** This is where you specify the maximum amount you\u2019re willing to spend, which will then be used in a \u201creverse auction\u201d on the marketplace.\\n5.  **How many replicas do you want to run?** This is pretty self-explanatory.\\n\\nAnd, that\u2019s it! Isn\u2019t that way easier than you thought it would be? There are many people hard at work at Overclock Labs as well as in small teams of independent developers within the Akash community who are building deployment and provider set-up solutions. This will make the process of interacting with Akash Network much easier. Eventually, someone with little to no technical expertise can operate on Akash.

Featuring Overclock Labs\u2019 CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Greg Osuri, and special guests from around the web3 space.\\n\\nOur guests on this week\u2019s Akash Weekly With Greg Osuri:\\n- Greg Osuri, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Overclock Labs (creators of Akash Network)\\n- Alani Kuye, Technical Program Manager at Overclock Labs\\n\\nEcosystem Updates\\n- Mainnnet 4 Is Coming Soon\\n- We plan to launch this network upgrade in the first week of November.\\n\\nThe features below are the four main upgrades of Mainnet 4.\\n**IP Leases**\\nIP Leases will allow tenants on Akash to request a publicly routable IP address for the services they deploy. Today, you get an HTTP endpoint connected to your service, and Kubernetes assigns the actual port. With IP Leases, a tenant on Akash can request a dedicated IPV4 address, allowing users to assign a specific port instead of a randomly assigned port. IP Leases will unlock the functionality to host Solana nodes on Akash Network.\\n\\n**Provider Services Split**\\nThis upgrade will separate parts of the behind-the-scenes development process for Overclock Labs and make it easier for us to iterate quickly as we build and grow Akash.\\n\\n**Cosmos IBC3**\\nIBC3 allows one chain to send transactions to another chain. This provides users with access to the most recent features of the Cosmos ecosystem.\\n\\n**Interchain Accounts**\\nBy enabling Interchain Accounts on Akash, we will provide access to interchain composability and significantly improve the user experience on Akash Network.\\n\\nAfter Mainnet 4 has launched, we will shift our focus to enabling GPU support on Akash. We have received significant interest in GPU support from large machine-learning companies. We look forward to enabling this feature to allow the machine-learning space to access the decentralized cloud.\\n\\n## Our special guest this week: Alani Kuye, Overclock Labs\\n**Alani Kuye is the Technical Program Manager at Overclock Labs.** Alani has spent the last 21 years in enterprise technology across the U.S. and Europe, with a focus on scalability and rapid deployment. He advocates through technology to drive the evolution of the internet. His personal and professional life span across the U.S., Amsterdam, London, Berlin, and other parts of the world.\\n\\n\u201cMany of our ecosystem partners ship products every one to two weeks, which is a testament to the strength of our community. Our ecosystem is based on innovation\u2014and brand loyalty to Akash Network.\u201d\\n\\nWhat is PTRI?\\nAkash Network\u2019s new program, the Provider and Tenant Retention Initiative (PTRI), incentivizes providers and tenants to participate in Akash Network. It seeks to lower the barrier to entry that sidelines many who want to interact with Akash\u2014on either side of the marketplace.\\n\\nAnyone can set up a Keplr wallet, generate a referral code, and share it with friends, family, or anyone else they choose. If someone uses that referral code to become a provider or a tenant on Akash (and remains active for a set period), the person who generated the code is rewarded.\\n\\nThis makes it easy for anyone, at any technical skill level, to get involved and spread the word about Akash Network.\\n\\n## Q&amp;A\\nQ: Is there a stable economic model that supports AKT?\\nA: Given the financial nature of this topic, please listen to Greg Osuri address this question.\\n\\nQ: Is there an airdrop coming for AKT stakers from the Passage?\\nA: We believe there will be an airdrop for AKT stakers, but please check Passage\u2019s Twitter for the official announcement of any potential airdrops.\\n\\nQ: How long do you think the adoption of Web3 will take?\\nA: Mainstream adoption of Web3 is already underway. As more people experience the benefits that Web3 technologies uniquely offer, they will begin to promote the use of these technologies, leading to exponential adoption over time.\\n\\nOfficial estimates project 2030 for mainstream adoption of Web3 cloud technologies. Greg Osuri believes we will reach mainstream adoption on a faster timeline\u2014with full mainstream adoption closer to 2027.\\n\\nQ: How will Interchain Accounts (ICA) be used on Akash Network?\\nA: Today, DAOs have to rely on centralized infrastructure, which is censorable. There is no way, currently, for a DAO to directly control deployments on a decentralized network. Interchain Accounts will allow a DAO on Juno Network (for example) to deploy directly on Akash Network.\\n\\nWith ICA, a smart contract can directly control a deployment without a person needing to manage that deployment.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly: Alani Kuye, Overclock Labs&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly With Greg Osuri \u2014 a live Twitter Spaces event held every Wednesday at 8am PT.

In that time, I\u2019ve seen exciting developments in our products and those built by a growing number of independent teams that are part of the Akash Network ecosystem. Several developments in the web3, crypto, and cloud computing markets have reinforced our vision and company mission.\\n\\nThis series of four articles will summarize how I see those developments, starting with this article\u2014which explores the current state of web3 infrastructure and the challenges that remain to be solved. The second article will delve into Akash Network\u2019s approach to solving those challenges. The third article will describe some of our latest product efforts in making it easier to deploy on Akash. The fourth article will highlight several projects from Akash\u2019s ecosystem that are contributing their efforts to our vision.\\n\\nIf you prefer listening over reading, [my talk at Messari Mainnet covers much of this content](https://youtu.be/jGqZzNWQrNs?t=10).\\n\\n## The State of Web3 Infrastructure\\n\\nWhile there is plenty that can be said when it comes to Web3 infrastructure across the different layers (L1-L3), for this discussion, I want to focus on three areas:\\n\\n- The current state of Layer 1 blockchain infrastructure.\\n- How infrastructure cost impacts the decentralization of chains.\\n- How better infrastructure and tooling can increase developer traction in Web3.\\n\\n## The Infrastructure Powering Top DApps Is Centralized\\n\\nEthereum and Solana are arguably two of the most popular chains among developers who build Decentralized Apps (DApps). Based on [stats published by State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/stats/platform/ethereum#new), Ethereum runs nearly 3,000 DApps.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664975700-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-9-14-49-am.png)\\n\\nThese DApps are powered by Ethereum\u2019s network of ~450K validators (source: [https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator](https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator)), which is impressive.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985200-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-11-53-07-am.png)\\n\\nIf you dig deeper, you\u2019ll see that five validator platforms own 75% of the staking pool, with the largest of them, Lido Finance, making up nearly 30%. (Source: [https://beaconcha.in/charts/pools_distribution](https://beaconcha.in/charts/pools_distribution))\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985365-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-11-55-41-am.png)\\n\\nIf we dig yet another layer deeper, things look even more centralized at the \u201cbare metal\u201d infrastructure layer. 75% of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet nodes run on three service providers: Amazon, Google, and Hetzner. (Source: [https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting](https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting))\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985516-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-11-58-31-am.png)\\n\\nThe chart above looked different only a few weeks ago. Hetzner and Google swapped places over the course of a few weeks (we\u2019ll cover how that happened shortly). The chart below shows how things looked in early September 2022:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985457-ethernodes-org.png)\\n\\nAlthough a similar chart doesn\u2019t seem to exist for Solana, I did find several articles talking about how more than a third of Solana\u2019s node infrastructure is also dependent on Amazon (AWS). See this article from [CoinRivet](https://coinrivet.com/it/amazon-hosts-37-of-actively-staked-sol-could-this-be-a-solana-kill-switch/):\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985571-solana.png)\\n\\nThe obvious takeaway from these stats is that the core (Layer 1) infrastructure that powers many popular chains and, therefore, most DApps are fairly centralized. This presents a huge risk to the Web3 ecosystem as a whole. For instance, if Amazon decided tomorrow that it wants nothing to do with crypto or chooses to build its own chain to compete with Ethereum\u2014it would cause significant disruption to the entire Web3 space.\\n\\nIf you think my concern is overblown, think again. One month ago, this is what Hetzner [decided to do](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hetzner-anti-crypto-policies-a-wake-up-call-for-ethereum-s-future):\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985640-hetzner-1.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664985671-hetzner-2.png)\\n\\nThis news is the likely reason for the increase in nodes deployed to Google Cloud over the last few weeks.\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking that in the worst-case scenario, where all the major public clouds decide to become \u201cclosed\u201d or anti-crypto, there are always independent data centers around the world where node operators could lease compute capacity.\\n\\nIn theory, that is true. In practice, the story is a little different. Leasing space in an independent data center is a manual, high-touch process relative to self-serve clouds like AWS. Independent data centers can involve significant capital expenditure (CapEx) if you intend to [co-locate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocation_centre) your infrastructure. There is reason to believe that the ease of use of self-serve public clouds has decreased the total number of data centers worldwide\u2014from about 8.5 million in 2015 to about 7.2 million in 2021.\\n\\n(Source: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/500458/worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/500458/worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites/))\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664987339-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-28-46-pm.png)\\n\\nWhile the number of data centers worldwide has declined in the last six to seven years, there are still an estimated 7.2 million data centers across the globe.\\n\\nOn average, only 15-20% of the compute capacity within these data centers is fully utilized.\\n\\nAnything we can do to more efficiently utilize excess compute capacity in these data centers would not only benefit the people running these businesses but would also benefit the planet from the standpoint of environmental sustainability.\\n\\n## Low-Cost Infrastructure Is the Key to Decentralization\\n\\nLet\u2019s assume we will keep running our Web3 node infrastructure in public clouds for the foreseeable future. What implications does this have on decentralization from a pure cost perspective?\\n\\nOne of the greatest misconceptions that people have about running workloads in public clouds is that it is _always_ cheaper than running those workloads in a data center. While this is often true for small teams and projects with small resource requirements, as those teams and projects scale, this becomes less and less true.\\n\\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for it. Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), arguably the biggest name in Web3 venture capital, called the cost of the public cloud a \u201cTrillion Dollar Paradox\u201d in a [blog post published in 2021](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986059-a16z-1.png)\\n\\na16z arrived at this thesis after studying the cost structure of several well-known public companies, including Palantir, Slack, Snowflake, Datadog, and Asana. They found that, on average, these large enterprise SaaS companies spend about 50% of their revenue on public cloud hosting.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986150-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-09-05-pm.png)\\n\\nAssuming the cost structure looks similar for the consumer apps we all use (Doordash, Grubhub, Lyft, Uber, Spotify, and others), this means that for every dollar you spend on these apps, nearly $0.50 is paid to a public cloud provider. a16z\u2019s mission is to find the next multi-billion dollar opportunity. Right now, they consider this to be the biggest opportunity in infrastructure.\\n\\nFrom _The Cost of Cloud, A Trillion Dollar Paradox_:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986255-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-10-39-pm.png)\\n\\nCloudflare, whose CDN and reverse-proxy infrastructure [powers nearly 80% of all websites](https://kinsta.com/cloudflare-market-share/), provides another data point related to cloud costs. In a blog post from July 2021, Cloudflare calls egress cost on AWS \u201c...egregious.\u201d\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986312-cloudflare-1.png)\\n\\nEgress cost is what AWS\u2019 customers pay to pull data (their own data!) out of AWS. While AWS charges nothing to bring data into AWS (the \u201dingress cost\u201d), it charges an arm-and-a-leg to pull data out of AWS. Rather than charging based on the size of the pipe a customer connects to AWS with, Amazon charges based on the amount of data you pull through that pipe. This starkly contrasts how a person is charged for their home broadband connection, where they pay the same cost (based on upload and download speeds) regardless of whether that person watches Netflix for three hours every day or simply uses their email and browses the web.\\n\\nWhile AWS charges its customers for the amount of data they pull through (and not the rate at which it flows), it pays the service provider based on the rate at which the data flows (and not the amount of data). In other words, this is the way that AWS makes it expensive to switch to another provider\u2014while earning a pretty penny every time their customers pull out data. The most important thing to keep in mind is that while AWS hasn\u2019t changed its stance despite Cloudflare and others calling it out, most data centers in the world today provide \u201cunmetered bandwidth\u201d where you pay a fixed cost based on the size of the connection rather than the amount of data you pull. This is yet another reason to consider deploying on one of those 7.2M data centers.\\n\\nWhat does all this have to do with decentralization? It\u2019s simple: As the Web3 space increasingly transitions to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, the role of validators becomes more and more critical to ensure chain security. As such, the more validators the chains have, the greater the security of the chains and, in turn, the DApps running on those chains. For there to be more validators, the cost of spinning one up must be low enough that nearly anyone can run a validator node. In other words, the lower the cost of the infrastructure to host validator nodes, the more decentralized these chains become.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986414-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-13-28-pm.png)\\n\\n## Developer Traction in Web3\\n\\nOutside of cost and security, the third biggest factor preventing Web3 applications from going mainstream is the availability of talented dApp developers. Here is a [chart from Electric Capital](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d) that tracks the number of Monthly Active Developers in Web3 over time:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986484-electric-capital-dev-report.png)\\n\\nCompare that with a similar chart from Statista showing the growth in total (Web2 plus Web3) developers over time:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986652-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-17-29-pm.png)\\n\\nWhile the \u201chockey-stick\u201d growth in Web3 developers is impressive in relative terms, the absolute number of developers (~18,500) pales in comparison to the total number of developers (~28M). Web3 developers only represent a tiny fraction (0.06%).\\n\\nWhile there are many reasons developers choose not to move to Web3 (including the fact that some scams and bad actors tend to make more news than legitimate value-generating projects), I believe that a key factor is the availability of a healthy \u201cdeveloper product ecosystem.\u201d\\n\\nOur friends at [Coinbase recently attempted to define a \u201cWeb3 Developer Stack.\u201d](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-simple-guide-to-the-web3-developer-stack) Here is what they came up with:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986688-coinbase-web3-dev-stack.png)\\n\\nI love this representation, not only because it is well researched but because it shows a burgeoning ecosystem of products in the Web3 developer world. While this is great to see, it is still a far cry from the developer product ecosystem that exists in Web2. To drive the point home with an equivalent image, here is a product ecosystem image from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)\u2019s website](https://landscape.cncf.io/):\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664986751-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-19-07-pm.png)\\n\\nKeep in mind that while the CNCF, part of the Linux Foundation, is arguably one of the largest open source communities, there are a plethora of (non-open-source) commercial solutions that are not represented in the image above.\\n\\nI present this data to say that anything we can do to foster growth in the ecosystem of tools for Web3 developers helps attract more talent to the space. These developers will not only build dApps but will also build even more tools. So, the space expands exponentially\u2014like a flywheel.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe state of Web3 infrastructure can be summarized in three points:\\n\\n1.  The heavy reliance on public clouds for core Layer 1 infrastructure is an existential risk to chains, nodes, and the DApps that run on those chains.\\n2.  The cost of public clouds is a significant barrier to entry for new validators. Therefore, finding a cheaper alternative that is also easy to use (if not better) is key to ensuring chain security across the space.\\n3.  The third-largest barrier to Web3 adoption is the availability of developer talent. One way to drive developer traction is to foster the growth of a healthy \u201cdeveloper product ecosystem,\u201d similar to the one that exists in the Web2 world.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1664987718-screen-shot-2022-10-05-at-12-35-15-pm.png)\\n\\nIf this topic has piqued your interest, stay tuned for the next article in this series.

The date will be announced soon.\\n\\n## Ecosystem Updates from Greg Osuri\\n\\nGreg Osuri appeared on Coinage with Zack Guzm\u00e1\u00f1. As Akash expands and grows, it is beginning to attract the attention of the large, centralized cloud providers.\\n\\n> \u201cThe goal of Akash is to bring people to the table and create a multi-cloud standard\u2026you\u2019re going to have big clouds and small clouds at the same table\u2014leveling the playing field. [This will] give the consumer the ultimate benefit. Optimizing the true cost of the cloud, while operating in a sovereign and open way.\u201d \u2014Greg Osuri\\n\\n**Overclock Labs launched its latest deployment promotion.** Follow the link in the tweet below to sign up to receive free credits to deploy an RPC node on Akash for up to three months. As everyone heads home from Cosmoverse and begins to shift back to building\u2014we want to make it easy for people to get up and running on the open cloud.\\n\\n## Adam Bozanich and Anil Murty on the Vision of Overclock Console and Building Akash Network\\n\\n**Adam Bozanich, CTO &amp; Co-Founder of Overclock Labs (Creators of Akash Network)**. Led software development at Symantec, One King\u2019s Lane, and Marketron. Before that, he worked as an engineer and developer for the music monetization platform Topspin\u2014acquired by Apple in 2014 after an initial acquisition by Beats. Adam holds a U.S. patent for Network Protocol Fuzzing, a security analysis methodology.\\n\\n**Anil Murty, Head of Product at Overclock Labs.** Anil is an Engineer turned Product Manager. He has a passion for building products that serve deeply technical users. He has worked on products ranging from consumer and enterprise hardware, software, and SaaS\u2014and most recently, cloud-native developer and observability tooling. Anil is based in the beautiful city of Portland, OR.\\n\\n### What\u2019s exciting about Overclock Console, and who are its intended users?\\n\\nOverclock Console fulfills much of the original vision for deploying on Akash Network. Akash network is already performant and cost-optimized. Console provides the last piece of the puzzle, making the deployment process on Akash easy and intuitive.\\n\\nOver time, Console will give users of Akash access to one-click deployments to launch validators, RPC nodes, and more.\\n\\nThere are many ways to deploy on Akash today, with each deployment tool taking an opinionated approach to deployment. Because Akash is such an extensive network, it represents a wide-ranging marketplace for potential deployments. There is plenty of room in the layer above Akash for many different tools to help users deploy, each tailored to a unique deployment style or user workflow.\\n\\nOverclock Labs\u2019 approach to Console has been to focus on making sure that we provide the best tools for Validators within the Cosmos ecosystem to be able to spin up nodes\u2014whether that is a full validator node, an RPC node, a sentry node, or anything else a Validator might want to deploy.\\n\\nPast Cosmos, we will widen our focus to other chains, whether that is Solana, Ethereum, or any others.\\n\\n### Mainnet 4 is coming soon.\\n\\nOverclock is gearing up to launch Mainnet 4 for Akash Network. Thankfully, the major upgrades are easy to remember\u2014as there are four.\\n\\nHere are the four major upgrades of Mainnet 4:\\n\\n1. IP Leases. This will allow tenants on Akash to request a publicly routable IP address for the services they deploy. Today, you get an HTTP endpoint connected to your service, and Kubernetes assign the actual port. With IP Leases, a tenant on Akash can request a dedicated IPV4 address, allowing users to assign a specific port instead of a randomly assigned port. This will unlock Solana node hosting on Akash Network.\\n\\n2. Provider Services Split. This upgrade will separate parts of the behind-the-scenes development process for Overclock Labs and make it easy to iterate quickly as we build and grow Akash.\\n\\n3. Cosmos IBC v3. IBC v3 and Interchain Accounts allow one chain to send transactions to another chain.\\n\\n4. Interchain Accounts. By enabling Interchain Accounts on Akash, we will open up an entirely new world of interchain composability and significantly improve the user experience on Akash Network.\\n\\nOur Akash Insiders were the first to gain access to IP Leases.\\n\\n### The Internet Lost Its Way\\n\\nIn its way, the core vision for Akash Network is to bring the internet back to its roots.\\n\\n\u201c[The Internet] had turned into this thing, where if US-West-1 goes down on AWS\u2014no apps work anymore. Clearly, there is a huge amount of centralization happening on the internet. That\u2019s one of the things we wanted to address.\u201d \u2014Adam Bozanich\\n\\nAkash is one step towards an internet that is more sovereign, independent, and open. An internet that works better for everyone.\\n\\n## Q&amp;A\\n\\nQ: What is unique about Akash, and how will that impact AKT?\\nA: Akash is the first attempt at an open and decentralized cloud. This will reduce the premium we all end up paying the centralized cloud\u2014which hosts most applications today.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly: Adam Bozanich and Anil Murty of Overclock Labs&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Our guests on this week\u2019s Akash Weekly With Greg Osuri - Greg Osuri, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Overclock Labs (creators of Akash Network). - Adam Bozanich, CTO &amp; Co-Founder of Overclock Labs.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-09-30T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CWMgf8Ck.jpeg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;orientation&quot;:[0,1],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-weekly-adam-bozanich-and-anil-murty-of-overclock-labs/banner-image.jpeg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-weekly-the-web3-regulatory-landscape/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-weekly-the-web3-regulatory-landscape&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;Welcome back to another issue of The Akash Weekly Newsletter from the team at Overclock Labs.\\n\\nTune into our weekly live Twitter Spaces event held every Wednesday at 8am PT.

This upgrade will include four main features: IP Leases, Provider Services Split, IBC3, and Interchain Accounts.\\n\\n### Interchain Accounts\\nInterchain Accounts (ICA) are coming to Akash Network with the Mainnet 4 upgrade, which is tentatively expected to happen in the first week of November.\\n\\nICAs bring a new phase of interoperability to IBC-compatible chains. With Interchain accounts, any IBC chain can call a method on Akash Network from its native account. For example, a Juno account could own a deployment on Akash. This will allows for a widespread cross-pollination of communities within Cosmos and eventually beyond.\\n\\n### Dimokus Deploys Hypersign via Spheron\\nAkash Insider, Dimokus, won a bug bounty contest from our ecosystem partner Spheron for building a Hypersign Validator Script for Akash Network.\\n\\n### A Thread on Akash From Elemental Crypto\\nCheck out this thread from Elemental Crypto on the fundamentals of Akash Network. We always appreciate the efforts of our community and their work in helping to explain our work in building an open and sovereign cloud.\\n\\n### Google Announces It Will Accept Crypto Payments\\nOn Tuesday, Google announced that it would begin to accept crypto payments for cloud services.\\n\\nCrypto payments will initially be rolled out to a handful of customers involved in the Web3 industry. Google will also user Coinbase's custody service, Coinbase Prime.\\n\\n\\&quot;We want to make building in Web3 faster and easier, and this partnership with Coinbase helps developers get one step closer to that goal,\\&quot; said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud.\\n\\n## Regulation &amp; Compliance In Web3\\nWe are excited to host this conversation on regulation and compliance in Web3 with our special guests this week. Given the wide-ranging experience and deep expertise of both guests, please find their full bios below:\\n\\n**Lourdes C. Miranda** \u2014 Chief Compliance Officer at Send Crypto.

Alani Bankhead is a career special agent and professional coach, consultant, and public speaker. With a career spanning almost two decades in federal and state government, Alani has hunted terrorists and spies both in and out of the Middle East on behalf of special operations, was a senior bodyguard to a top Pentagon official, and ultimately found her passion in protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 our children \u2014 from sexual exploitation. Alani started the Air Force\u2019s Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force mission almost 15 years ago in Japan. And since leaving active duty, she has overseen law enforcement investigations, operations, and hosted national law enforcement training in Latin America for the US\u2019s largest anti-slavery non-profit focusing on the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) also known as child sexual trafficking. Alani eventually transitioned to Hawaii where she created and led the largest anti-child exploitation cyber operations in the Pacific comprised of federal, state, local, and military law enforcement agencies resulting in the arrest of almost 100 child sex abusers, the identification and recovery of 35+ live child victims, and a 96% conviction or plea rate. Still serving as a Lieutenant Colonel and Agent in the Air Force reserves, Alani currently works as a coach and consultant to enable larger groups of law enforcement and prosecutors to be equipped to handle the growing issue of child exploitation online. Alani has given dozens of conference presentations and talks including a TEDx talk.\\n\\nThis conversation is wide-ranging and touches on essential and difficult topics around how Web3 companies, protocols, and tools preserve privacy and enable freedom\u2014but also potentially enables new attack vectors for bad actors.\\n\\nThis conversation covers far too much ground to transcribe fully in this newsletter. We recommend listening to the entire discussion between Greg Osuri, Lourdes C. Miranda, and Alani Bankhead.\\n\\n[Watch the full recording on YouTube](https://youtu.be/6r_OON8CNPs)\\n\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly: The web3 regulatory landscape&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Welcome back to another issue of The Akash Weekly Newsletter from the team at Overclock Labs.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-09-30T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Zach Horn&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CWMgf8Ck.jpeg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1920],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1080],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;orientation&quot;:[0,1],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-weekly-the-web3-regulatory-landscape/banner-image.jpeg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-insiders-spotlight-rodrigo-rochin/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-insiders-spotlight-rodrigo-rochin&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n_Today, we are featuring a profile of one of our Akash Insider community members\u2014Rodrigo Rochin, known on the_ [_Akash Discord_](https://discord.com/invite/akash) _as \\&quot;Rodri.\\&quot; Rodrigo will introduce himself in his own words, share his background, how he came to find Akash Network, and his experience with the Akash Insiders._\\n\\n_Enter, Rodrigo:_\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a crypto enthusiast since around 2016, I have seen Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as many other crypto assets and projects, grow and prosper over the years.\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to mine some cryptocurrencies with my own CPUs and GPUs, as well as with rented ones. I got to use some of the earliest faucets, sportsbooks and \u201clottery\u201d games\u2014but I have also seen many \u201crugpulls\u201d, censorship cases and other problems too.\\n\\nI have believed in the utility and transparency of blockchain technology since I first found out about it. Today, I still believe in its capacity to solve different types of problems around the world, such as a store of value, almost instant payments and very low fees.\\n\\nBack then, we did not have as many communities, projects, companies, institutions or governments involved as we do today, which is why I see more potential in this industry every day.\\n\\nI can no longer recall how many times I have read or seen that a government or authority is going to end Bitcoin and crypto once and for all, but in the end, blockchain technology and Web3 keep improving.\\n\\n## My Venture Into the Cosmos\\n\\nIn 2019/2020, while learning about DeFi, NFTs and trying to find alternatives to extremely high gas fees on the Ethereum network, I found the Cosmos Ecosystem.\\n\\nWhen I read about Atom, Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK, I realised the incredible work that many people are doing here, how visionary they are and the amazing open source technology that they have developed.\\n\\nFrom the opportunity to build your own unique blockchain, to the opportunity of completing blockchain transactions in a few seconds and using DEXs at almost no gas fees, to projects that offer real solutions like Sentinel DVPN, Regen Network and one of my favourite ones\u2014Akash Network.\\n\\nI used my free time to work on my own [**NFT project**](https://www.moonbys.com/) and education. I read more about the Cosmos SDK and Starport (now rebranded to Ignite). I learned how to build my own blockchain, how to run nodes and become a validator for different Cosmos SDK-based chains, how to use smart contracts for NFTs and thanks to Akash, I have learned about Docker, Kubernetes and decentralization.\\n\\n## Building On The Decentralized Cloud\\n\\nAfter understanding what Akash\u2019s mission is and how anyone can use this cloud computing marketplace to become decentralized and censorship-resistant (while also saving on costs, when compared to traditional cloud providers), I got more involved in Akash\u2019s Discord and forum\u2014and I began to learn how to deploy my own apps and infra on Akash Network\u2019s decentralized cloud.\\n\\nAt first, it did take me a few days to understand how to use Akash, but after the small learning curve, I realised how convenient it is and how it makes it possible for anyone with an Internet connection to host a website, and to run applications and blockchain nodes.\\n\\nAnyone with a little over five AKT can start using Akash Network. At first, I used the Akash binary and command line, but now we have tools like Cloudmos, which makes it extremely simple to deploy your projects onto the Akash Network.\\n\\nThanks to [Akash Provider Console](https://provider-console.akash.network/) it is also now very easy to become a provider, allowing anyone to take advantage of their idle compute resources and earn some AKT.\\n\\nThese are all things that help to decentralize the cloud industry, give more opportunities to people around the world and that help to promote freedom of speech.\\n\\n## Becoming an Insider\\n\\nWhile learning about Akash, I participated in multiple hackathons and contributed to some of its blog content.\\n\\nI was invited to become an [Akash Insider](https://akash.network/community#insiders) and I did not think about it twice. I knew it was a great opportunity to grow, to learn and to promote something that I believe in.\\n\\nIn the last 15 months or so, I have virtually met some of the people behind Akash. I have witnessed how hard the team works every day, how they keep improving this cloud computing marketplace and how they have made it a reality.\\n\\nI have had the opportunity to test out new features before they are made public. I got the chance to participate in different tasks, which helped me to learn more about blockchain tech, Web3, Docker and Kubernetes.\\n\\n## Decentralization Is Now a Requirement\\n\\nAfter reading news about governments trying to ban crypto assets, about innocent developers being jailed and about companies like Hetzner Cloud, Steam and WeChat banning everything related to blockchain technology, Web3 and NFTs, I am now sure that we need decentralized cloud computing more than ever.\\n\\nI think that having people provide their unused computer resources opens up new opportunities for Web3, blockchain tech, gaming and freedom of speech, while also helping to reduce worldwide energy consumption.\\n\\nWhile we have been accustomed to not self-hosting or opening up our internet connections to the world, I think that it is now time to change paradigms and decentralize the cloud industry.\\n\\nWhile the space does need regulation, completely banning these technologies is not the right path forward. These technologies offer many more benefits than most people realise, which is why more of us are using them daily.\\n\\nThese are only some of the reasons why I believe in the benefits of blockchain tech, in the simple user experience that Web3 provides, the utility of NFTs and a decentralized cloud.\\n\\nThese are also some of the reasons why I will keep providing my idle compute resources to the decentralized cloud, why as an Akash Insider I will keep helping others to learn about these technologies and why I will keep building my own project, [Moonbys.com](https://moonbys.com/), which has several parts hosted on Akash Network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Interested in Becoming an Akash Insider?\\n\\nPlease&nbsp;[head over to our Akash Insiders page](https://akash.network/community#insiders)&nbsp;to get a feel for the community.

He was a solutions architect and led large teams across his career\u2014spanning eight years. He believes that for Web3 to succeed, we will need scalable infrastructure that is native to Web3 and the ethos of decentralization.\\n\\nThe challenge in building web3 is finding decentralized infrastructure. The purpose of Spheron is to make the decentralized ecosystem accessible for developers and builders.\\n\\nSpheron is launching its marketplace in the coming weeks. This will address the growing problem of developers wanting to move to Web3, and onto decentralized networks, but lacking a solution that is easy and intuitive.\\n\\nSpheron will be launching on Optimism, Arbitrum, and eventually onto most EVM-compatible chains within the next 2-3 months. Behind the scenes, Akash Network will be facilitating access to decentralized compute\u2014regardless of the chain.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCheng Wang, CFO of Overclock Labs on Token Unlocks\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Overclock Labs](https://ovrclk.com/)\u2019 CFO,&nbsp;[Cheng Wang](https://twitter.com/LeChenghiskhan), joins us today to talk about AKT and token unlocks. Cheng leads financial operations and strategy at Overclock Labs.\\n\\nPrior to Overclock Labs, Cheng served as the CFO for Workshop, a premier blockchain startup. He spent over eight years at premier financial institutions, before founding and managing his own retail businesses in NYC. His experience includes extended tenures with Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and RBS\u2014where he served as a Vice President, focusing on debt and valuations. His financial expertise includes equity, debt valuations, derivatives instruments, and portfolio management.\\n\\n_Given the financial nature of this section\u2014_[_please listen to Cheng directly in the full audio recording_](https://youtu.be/1SjcSAQKY7g?t=1194)_._\\n\\n_Nothing mentioned here, or in the audio recording, should be construed as financial advice._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nQ&amp;A\\n---\\n\\n### Q: Is there any chance the team is planning to improve the volume and liquidity of AKT on centralized exchanges?\\n\\nA: AKT is listed on Kraken, Ascendex, and Kucoin\u2014among others. We are always seeking additional exchange venues that would be a good fit for listing AKT.\\n\\nFor background, the process to be listed on a centralized exchange is arduous. Each exchange has its own economic considerations, its own pipelines, and things to weigh. Simply listing on an exchange will not necessarily drive volume. Product and user adoption is more likely to drive volume over the long term.\\n\\n### Q: How will the last token unlock affect the price of AKT?\\n\\nA:&nbsp;_(_[_As before, please listen to Cheng speak directly to this question in the audio recording_](https://youtu.be/1SjcSAQKY7g?t=2311)_)._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[Listen to the full recording of this Akash Weekly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SjcSAQKY7g)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly With Greg Osuri: Messari Mainnet, Spheron, Token Unlocks, and More&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri is our weekly community call hosted on Twitter Spaces.

The difference between open systems on Web3 and the closed systems of Web2, are the increases in functionality that come with Web3 networks. The open systems that characterize Web3 come with massive increases in functionality and composability\u2014a large portion of the Web3 learning curve is understanding the full scope of these decentralized, open source networks.\\n\\nImproving the developer experience has the potential to take Web3 to places that Web2 couldn\u2019t reach.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nQ&amp;A\\n---\\n\\n### Q: How is MASQ similar to what Sentinel is doing with their dVPN?\\n\\nA: Sentinel uses a single-point VPN to route users\u2019 traffic. MASQ hops traffic across three other users (like Tor). There is no central point of failure for MASQ, as it is a \u2018mesh network\u2019\u2014although both are decentralized tools.\\n\\n### Q: How is the Brave browser similar or different from MASQ?\\n\\nA: MASQ is focused on creating Web3-native features. An average user won\u2019t be able to tell that MASQ\u2019s entire stack is decentralized, which makes for a seamless user experience.\\n\\n### Q: Akash has another token unlock upcoming. How is this expected to impact AKT?\\n\\nA: We remain confident that our investors are focused on Akash over the long term.

I have over five years of experience in the banking sector, going through different departments like social media, sales, quality assurance, and compliance. I've always been drawn to content creation and social media, and I've been involved in projects like a car wash, taking pictures, food, and personal finance.\\n\\nInstafinanzas was born from the idea that it's possible to turn your finances around. However, the steps are not clear for many people. Through instafinanzas, I am able to help a wide array of individuals that are looking to change their approach to finances. I\u2019ve helped people work on budgeting, paying off loans, and how to get started with investing.\\n\\nI learned about Bitcoin around November 2020 through a platform called eToro. I was impressed with how expensive 1 BTC was, and since I had demo money in the account, I bought some BTC. Then, I forgot about eToro and when checked the account again in February 2021\u2014the profits I made were huge! I was happy but didn't know exactly what Bitcoin could be used for. So, I read the Bitcoin whitepaper, watched some YouTube videos, and fell down the rabbit hole.\\n\\nI spent a decent amount of time reading and understanding Bitcoin. This reading helped me see the flaws in our current financial system, and it just made sense to me, got orange pilled by myself!! I think bitcoin is freedom and all the technology that came after BTC will empower us to do incredible things, same as the internet helps us communicate and work in ways never thought before. The same will happen with cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nI still run instafinanzas' Instagram, and now I use it to spread awareness about cryptocurrencies and to showcase my Cosmos Journey. In the future, I\u2019d like instafinanzas to become The Hub, which will be filled with news, info, and entertainment content around cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n## Making The Jump Into Web3\\n\\nIn my early days in crypto, I learned lots about DeFI, NFTs, the concept of \u201crugpulls,\u201d and the communities behind various projects. During this time, I joined all the groups I could. My phone battery wouldn't last more than two hours due to all the messages, but I loved it. The vibe, the \u201cWAGMI\u201d culture, and, of course, the technology. I got deeply involved in a few projects, mostly as a mod answering users\u2019 questions and chitchatting. However, most of the time I was reading about new projects and how they worked.\\n\\nIn July 2021, an old friend shared a podcast episode with Cryptocito, and he was talking about Cosmos, interoperability, and how the future was cross-chain. I started researching ATOM, Cosmos, IBC, and their future possibilities.\\n\\nThe Cosmos rabbit hole is something else. There are so many apps, projects, developers, and governance\u2014there's not a boring day in the Cosmos ecosystem. I applied the same formula from my previous experience, learning as much as I could while connecting with people and helping others. I still had a regular job at this point, and crypto was taking up so much of my time that I thought, what if I could get a job in crypto?\\n\\nI consider myself to be bold and intrepid, so I went job hunting and found pages full of web3 jobs. On a side note, I still share any open jobs I find in my telegram channel _Crypto Jobs Latam_ so I can help more Latin Americans make the switch to web3.\\n\\nDuring my search, I saw that Stakin had an open position, and the description was similar to what I was already doing. So, I applied and was hired.\\n\\n## My Experience Working at Stakin\\n\\nI\u2019ve been working for Stakin since January 2022, and what I do is strengthen Stakin\u2019s relationship with its networks while helping our delegators in their crypto journey. I use many different strategies to achieve these goals. Content creation is one of the main ways we contribute to our networks, and I try to make it special in every iteration. I take my time to deliver greatness, although, the crypto market is so fast-paced that I had to learn how to deliver more quickly.\\n\\nI've learned many things while working at Stakin, engaged in governance conversation, and decentralization initiatives, while getting an overview of many Cosmos apps, their updates, the communities, and where they are heading. Practice makes perfect, and going back to my first articles and Twitter spaces, my rookie mistakes were apparent. But you just learn from those and move on, there's room for improvement but you have to do the job! Also, I\u2019ve learned a lot from others. I'm thankful for all the quality people I have met in the space. Being able to work in crypto has been a blessing. I proudly represent Stakin and I'm happy to join hands with people that want the best for the ecosystem.\\n\\n## How I Found the Akash Insiders and My Experience So Far\\n\\nI initially got into Cosmos and from there, discovered other networks. I remember listening to a discussion about Akash Network, and I got interested and started doing more research. Akash is one of the networks where Stakin is a validator, and I got the chance to study Akash closely, its community, and the team behind it. I saw myself spending more and more time on Discord, reading, and sometimes trying to be of assistance.\\n\\nNetworks in the Cosmos ecosystem often have ambassador programs, that recruit enthusiastic, talented, and dedicated individuals to spread the word. Akash has its own ambassador program called the [Akash Insiders](https://akash.network/community#insiders). These are people who have skills, know the tech, and get direct support from the Akash team. The goal? To speed up the decentralized cloud revolution.\\n\\nI\u2019ve applied for the Insiders two times. The first time, I got rejected, but it didn't matter. I deepened my knowledge, improved my skills, and developed relations within the community. The second time I applied, I got in! You have to know what you want to do and never give up! Find something bigger than you. Find a purpose, and attach yourself to it. I\u2019m honored to contribute to Akash\u2019s mission, and I\u2019m looking forward to the experiences and learnings that will come my way.\\n\\nI\u2019m eager to see all the things that The Insiders will be able to achieve in this new phase of Akash Network. The tech is being refined, the marketing team has been assembled, and the Insiders are ready!\\n\\nCrypto gives us an alternative. It gives us ways to make things different. The decentralized economy needs a decentralized infrastructure\u2014one that users can use and trust for its reliability. However, there's not much info out there, and some use cases are too complex for the average person at the moment. Let\u2019s change that!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Interested in Becoming an Akash Insider?\\n\\nPlease [head over to our Akash Insiders page](https://akash.network/community#insiders) to get a feel for the community and the link to apply!\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Insiders Spotlight: Del Rey&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Today, we are featuring a profile of one of our Akash Insider community members\u2014Del Rey, AKA \\&quot;Instafinanzas.\\&quot; Del Rey will introduce himself in his own words, share his background, how he came to find Akash Network, and his experience with the Akash Insiders.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-09-15T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;General&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Akash Insiders&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.gMnDKE8R.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1828],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1326],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-insiders-spotlight-del-rey/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-deploy-on-akash-network-using-authz/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-deploy-on-akash-network-using-authz&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAuthZ is a feature that allows one wallet to spend the funds in another wallet, up to a specified limit.\\n\\n## Deploying with AuthZ on Akash\\n\\nLet\u2019s walk through a simple \u201cHello World\u201d deployment with Cloudmos' deploy tool, using AuthZ to pay for the deployment.\\n\\nAfter following the on-screen instructions to set up your Cloudmos wallet and create a certificate, you should see the screen below:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1663102509-screen-shot-2022-09-13-at-4-45-50-pm.png)\\n\\n## Create the Deployment\\n\\nClick **\u201cHello Akash World\u201d**\\n\\nThen **\u201cCreate Deployment\u201d**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1663102593-screen-shot-2022-09-13-at-4-46-52-pm.png)\\n\\n## Specify the Funding Wallet\\n\\nIn the box below, set the initial deposit amount.

Here are a few highlights from across the ecosystem:\\n\\n[**Coinbase features Akash as one of the top solutions for decentralized compute.**](https://twitter.com/gregosuri/status/1565367900415729664?s=20&amp;t=663NidiSuMYth4JJxwyrew) This week, Coinbase published a guide for Web3 developers highlighting projects from all parts of the Web3 ecosystem. The projects included make up all the protocols and tools needed to develop a fully decentralized Web3 application. In the section for decentralized cloud compute\u2014Akash Network was featured as the leading network in the category. This further highlights that Akash Network is top-of-mind for developers looking to create truly decentralized applications.\\n\\n[**Spheron**](https://spheron.network/) **and Akash Network are official integration partners.** Spheron has been working closely with Akash Network over the past few weeks, and we are excited to announce that Spheron will feature Akash Network as its featured integration. We look forward to seeing even more growth from Spheron on Akash.\\n\\n[**Cloudmos**](https://cloudmos.io/) **officially announces its custom SDL builder.** Cloudmos has launched a tool that allows a user to easily define the parameters for their deployments, and the tool will do the work of automatically creating the SDL (Stack Definition Language) needed to create the deployment. This will make it even easier for more users to define many different types of applications and remove another potential barrier to deployment.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Greg Osuri gives a preview of on-chain deployments on Akash Network.** Check out the YouTube recording of this Akash Weekly to hear Greg explain how this feature could potentially work in his own words.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nComdex Is Building the DeFi Infrastructure Layer for the Cosmos Ecosystem\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Comdex](https://comdex.one/), a suite of DeFi solutions for the Cosmos ecosystem, started as a solution for digitizing the commodities trade industry\u2014one of the largest industries in the world and the \u201clifeblood of the supply chain globally,\u201d according to Siddarth Patil, COO of Comdex, \u201c...as the crypto ecosystem legitimizes itself, we want to build the infrastructure rails for facilitating that interaction of capital between DeFi and CeFi.\u201d\\n\\nComdex intends to build out a full-fledged ecosystem to bring real-world assets on-chain. They have started building a stablecoin protocol called CMST, which is live on testnet, along with a decentralized exchange called cSwap. [Explore the rest of Comdex\u2019s ecosystem here](https://docs.comdex.one/comdex-ecosystem).\\n\\nMany parts of Comdex\u2019s apps are hosted on Akash Network, and they are working to bring even more of their ecosystem onto Akash. They mention that it is critical for DeFi to move to decentralized infrastructure.\\n\\nSiddarth notes that Comdex discovered Akash Network through its visibility in the Cosmos ecosystem, and also through meetings with Greg Osuri, CEO of Overclock Labs, and [Boz Menzalji, COO of Overclock Labs](https://twitter.com/boz_menzalji).\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCloudmos Is Building Tools for Akash and the Cosmos Ecosystem\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Cloudmos](https://cloudmos.io/) is a set of tools, and a deployment platform, made for Akash Network and its ecosystem. These tools include: A fully functional block explorer with built-in analytics, a deploy tool GUI for easily creating deployments, as well as being a validator for Akash Network.\\n\\nMax found Akash Network through its visibility in the Cosmos ecosystem, much like Comdex.&nbsp;\\n\\nCloudmos is an alum of [Akash Accelerator](https://akash.network/akash-accelerator) and remains a participant in the program. Max notes that his discussions and meetings with Alani Kuye, Technical Program Manager at Overclock Labs, have helped Cloudmos to better align its roadmap and vision. Akash Accelerator is a great way to get guidance and actionable advice straight from the Overclock Labs teams.\\n\\nMax is also a founding member of the [Akash Insiders](https://akash.network/community#insiders). The Akash Insiders program is a great way to get deeply involved with the core of the Akash Network community and to get access to new features before they are fully released to the network. The Insiders are managed day-to-day by [Adam Wozney](https://twitter.com/AdamDeanWozney), Head of Community at Overclock Labs.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nQ&amp;A\\n---\\n\\n### Q: What are the personal uses of a proxy server?\\n\\nA: A proxy server could be used to cache certain parts of a web application for different regions. It could also be used to reduce bandwidth costs by caching a webpage.&nbsp;\\n\\n### Q: How can a beginner use the SDL builder?\\n\\nA: Greg notes that the SDL builder will greatly simplify the creation process, and make it easier to deploy seamlessly to Akash.\\n\\n### Q: How will fiat payments on Akash affect AKT (Akash\u2019s Utility Token)?&nbsp;\\n\\nA: Fiat payments will make it easier for more people to access Akash Network. Most of the world is not Web3-fluent and is more familiar with fiat payments systems. As Akash\u2019s adoption increases, projects like Vix\u0113llo will allow enterprises and others to access the network with seamless fiat payments.\\n\\nCrucially, fiat payments will not hinder the usage of AKT. Projects that offer fiat payments will still have to acquire AKT in order to facilitate those deployments on Akash Network. The only way to deploy on Akash at the base level is with AKT.&nbsp;\\n\\nMore payment types will increase the usage of AKT by bringing ultimately bringing more users to the network.\\n\\n### Q: What does Kava Proposal 97 mean for Akash Network?&nbsp;\\n\\nA: Kava Foundation recently announced their Ecosystem Fund. They will finance companies that are going to build on Kava, and they also want to ensure that these companies are aligned with the ethos of decentralization and Akash Network. Kava will be providing rewards to those selected companies building on Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash Network is proud to collaborate with Kava Network, and we look forward to working together to support and enable builders in the Cosmos ecosystem to create a more robust, decentralized future.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nClosing Thoughts from Greg Osuri\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nCloudmos began as Akashlytics, which was built by Max as a separate application\u2014and not affiliated with the core team at Overclock Labs. Over time, the application evolved into a fully-fledged deployment platform with many tools that provide value to the ecosystem. Many other developers have followed suit in building apps for Akash.\\n\\nWe are proud to see the organic growth the Akash ecosystem has achieved over time. This is what will take Akash to the next level, and bring more and more adoption to the network.\\n\\nOrganic growth is a long road. It takes time, and a strong product-market fit to achieve real growth\u2014growth that is not purely the result of incentives.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly With Greg Osuri: Comdex and Cloudmos Are Building the Future of Cosmos&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri is our weekly community call hosted on Twitter Spaces.

With Bladebit Disk, a Chia user has greater flexibility to create plots according to their time and cost preference.\\n\\nChia currently has three software options for plotting: MadMax, Bladebit, and Bladebit Disk. MadMax optimizes the original Chia reference plotting software while maintaining similar performance. Bladebit has very high system requirements (416GB of DRAM), making it suited to high-performance systems or those with access to virtual compute environments. With the addition of Bladebit Disk, users can create plots with more flexible system requirements.&nbsp;\\n\\nBladebit Disk is compatible with most home computing setups but also scales exceptionally well in virtualized Kubernetes environments. This makes Bladebit Disk the best choice for those looking to create Chia plots from their home system\u2014and especially those creating plots via Akash Network.\\n\\nHow much can Akash providers earn from Bladebit Disk?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nChia plotting on Akash Network is a very profitable workload for Akash providers. This is due to the high demand for Chia plots and the flexibility of using Akash for Plotting-as-a-Service.&nbsp;\\n\\nCurrently, providers can earn between $200-350/month with a $0.15/plot cost on modern hardware (defined as hardware produced within the last three years).\\n\\nAs a reference for Bladebit and MadMax pricing, the chart below is from our Summer Sale\u2014which offered Chia plots for $0.10/plot.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1662672470-screen-shot-2022-09-08-at-5-27-30-pm.png)\\n\\nHow do Akash providers upgrade to support Bladebit Disk?\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs a provider, becoming compatible with Bladebit Disk is as simple as upgrading your hardware. Below are the ideal requirements for running Bladebit Disk:\\n\\n*   24 CPUs\\n    \\n*   128 GB DRAM&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   1TB Ephemeral Storage (NVMe or RAID SSDs)\\n    \\n\\nIf any providers have questions about upgrading their hardware, or about Bladebit Disk in general\u2014please reach out through the [Akash Network Community Discord](https://discord.gg/RAJSe4a7JG).\\n\\nHow to run Bladebit Disk on Akash\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nAnyone who would like to run Bladebit Disk today can do so using the steps below:\\n\\n1.  Launch [**Cloudmos**](http://cloudmos.io/) (formerly Akashlytics)\\n    \\n2.  Navigate to **Templates**\\n    \\n3.  Then **Mining**\\n    \\n4.  Run **Bladebit Disk**\\n    \\n\\nAkash is a fast and flexible way to run any application\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBladebit Disk was live on Akash Network only eight hours after its launch. There are only a few simple steps to bring any application to the network. Create a Docker file, publish it to our Awesome Akash repository, and create a pull request. If the pull request is accepted into the main branch, it will be available for providers and through [Cloudmos](http://cloudmos.io/) (formerly Akashlytics). The speed and efficiency of this process are how Akash was able to be the first to run Bladebit Disk.\\n\\nThis entire process is seamless and is available to anyone who would like to make a pull request to our [Awesome Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) repository.&nbsp;\\n\\nThis simple process showcases how seamless it is to make new software available to everyone on Akash Network.

Many on Twitter suggested Akash as a decentralized Web3 solution for developers looking to build on an open cloud without fearing arbitrary censorship and banning.\\n\\n**Akash Network generated more than 7,000 tweets per hour at the peak trending volume.**\\n\\nThis publicity is a testament to the work being done by Overclock Labs in building and supporting the Akash Ecosystem. This also reflects the continued efforts of Akash\u2019s incredible community, who help the network grow and evolve. Keep up the great work, keep sharing your projects, and keep engaging with us on social media\u2014we love seeing your efforts!\\n\\n### Chia Partners with Akash Network for Bladebit Disk Launch\\n\\n[Chia Network](https://www.chia.net/) has partnered with Akash Network for the launch of their new plotting software, Bladebit Disk. This new version of the popular Bladebit plotting software makes it easier for users to create plots across a broader range of system requirements. Bladebit Disk also scales exceptionally well in virtualized Kubernetes environments\u2014making Akash a perfect launch partner to help users experience everything Bladebit Disk has to offer.\\n\\nWe are proud to work with Chia to bring Bladebit Disk to people around the world, and we look forward to continued collaboration on future projects.\\n\\n### Akash Network Officially Welcomes Spheron\\n\\nWe would like to welcome [Spheron](https://spheron.network/) to Akash Network as a protocol client. Spheron is a developer-friendly platform that makes it simple to deploy Javascript-based applications to the cloud. We are excited to welcome them to the ecosystem and look forward to seeing them grow on Akash Network.\\n\\n### The Akash Community Continues to Grow\\n\\nWe are excited to see our community continue to expand and evolve as more projects choose Akash as the decentralized Web3 network of choice.\\n\\nWe would like to highlight&nbsp;[Cloudmos](https://cloudmos.io/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Akash Console](https://provider-console.akash.network/)&nbsp;for their continued work building great products that make it easy for anyone to access Akash Network.\\n\\n[Our Ecosystem page on akash.network](https://akash.network/ecosystem/showcase/latest/) showcases all the projects currently on Akash Network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Enterprises Begin to Repatriate Their Data Centers\\n\\nThe $500 billion cloud infrastructure industry is undergoing a massive shift. Enterprises are beginning to realize that over time, the centralized cloud is an expensive proposition.\\n\\nThe co-founders of Overclock Labs wrote about the concept in the whitepaper that launched Akash Network. It has been an amazing journey watching this early vision of the cloud industry\u2019s progression become a reality.\\n\\nIt will be likely that these repatriated data centers will have underutilized compute\u2014which creates an incredible adoption opportunity for Akash Network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## An Overview of the Developer Experience on Akash with Ali Merchant\\n\\nAli views the development of blockchain technology as similar to the early internet. It\u2019s important for developers to begin to learn about blockchain, and the potential impacts it will have on many industries.\\n\\nWeb3 and blockchain technology are not necessarily perfect solutions for every problem. Understanding where to apply Web3 tech to solve specific problems requires more than a passing understanding of the technology. Developers have the opportunity to begin learning and experimenting with the technology before it reaches the mainstream. This will give adventurous developers a head start on the adoption of blockchain technology more broadly.\\n\\nAli first learned about Akash in 2017. He notes that one of the things that drew him to Akash was the platform being live and operational in a space where many other projects are not. Akash Network was providing value immediately to its users, is still building on that functionality today, and has a strong roadmap planned for the future.\\n\\nAli believes that Akash Network will shine as Web3 reaches mainstream adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Q&amp;A\\n\\n### Q: How decentralized are Akash\u2019s validator nodes?\\n\\nA: Akash validators can run on any provider platform, including colocation data centers and on bare metal. We are working on reporting to gain more information about the state of Akash\u2019s validators.\\n\\n### Q: Is there a team within Overclock Labs working on enterprise adoption?\\n\\nA: We are always working towards increasing adoption, especially for enterprise providers and tenants. We have a business development team that is always open to conversations around moving onto Akash Network.\\n\\n### Q: Is there a plan to support something like Firecracker in the future?\\n\\nA: Firecracker support is coming soon to Akash Network.\\n\\n### Q: Is there an attribute filtering mechanism on Akash Network?\\n\\nA: Yes, there is a way to filter for certain provider attributes. Providers will also advertise when they make new features available to the network.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri: August Updates, and Ali Merchant on Akash\u2019s Developer Experience&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri is our weekly community call hosted on Twitter Spaces.

We would like to highlight two new projects that have recently been deployed on Akash:&nbsp;  \\n  \\n[**Stakewolle**](https://stakewolle.com/) is a staking service provider for multiple chains across the space.  \\n  \\n[**Money.space**](https://money.space/) enables deep interblockchain liquidity for stable assets.  \\n  \\nIf you deploy a project on Akash, be sure to include the Powered by Akash logo on the project site, and tweet us at [@akashnet\\\\_](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) with the hashtag #PoweredByAkash to be discovered by the Akash community.  \\n  \\n**Allnodes lists Akash Network**  \\n[Allnodes](https://www.allnodes.com/), a non-custodial platform for node hosting and staking, has listed Akash Network. This gives Akash even more exposure to the wider staking ecosystem.  \\n  \\n**Cloudmos\u2019 On-Chain Funding**  \\nCongratulations to [Cloudmos](https://cloudmos.io/) for the approval of their on-chain fundraise. This is a testament to the strength of the community in supporting its favorite projects on Akash and across the Cosmos ecosystem.  \\n  \\n**DeFund Airdrop to AKT Holders**  \\n[Check out DeFund's article for more information.](https://medium.com/defund-finance/airdrop-d-c2685d282858)  \\n  \\n[**Dimokus**](https://twitter.com/Dimokus_vrn) **(Akash Insider) is Working to Enable VPN Deployments on Akash**  \\nOnce finished, it will be easy for anyone to deploy a VPN on Akash. Although there will be a slight tradeoff in performance, a VPN on Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud gives users complete control over access to the VPN itself, and also to the VPN\u2019s log files\u2014which is key to maintaining true privacy online.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Greg Osuri Addresses Misguided Akash FUD**  \\n  \\nThere has been some FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) on Twitter recently, stemming from a tweet that claimed to show&nbsp;data that many nodes on Akash were running on a very well-known centralized cloud provider.  \\n  \\nThis is simply false.  \\n  \\nThe data in the tweet appears to show testing data and does not reflect the actual active providers currently on Akash Network. It is unknown whether this misleading data was posted maliciously, or if the poster simply did&nbsp;not know how to compile accurate provider data from the network. We have reached out to them, but have received no response.  \\n  \\nWe will publish our own analysis on this topic in the coming weeks. In the meantime, our preliminary data suggests that there are zero nodes running on the large centralized provider in question.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Julian Morales Gives an Overview of Vix\u0113llo**  \\n  \\nVix\u0113llo is a validator on Akash network and a platform for staking, delegating, and governance. They started with validator nodes across several projects, and are working to expand their offerings over time.  \\n  \\nTheir roadmap includes building a seamless on-ramp to Akash Network by offering credit card payment and invoicing. This will enable enterprises to access Akash that currently cannot use decentralized networks because of the inability to receive an invoice for payments made on the network.  \\n  \\nJulian's \u2018lightbulb\u2019 moment for Akash Network came from his first-hand experience with the product. He quickly realized that not only was deploying on Akash possible today\u2014it was better than many other alternatives. This is something we hear over and over again from new members of the Akash ecosystem.&nbsp;  \\n  \\nVix\u0113llo notes that the experience of being a validator on Akash has been seamless. The team at Overclock Labs is always ready and available to make onboarding as a provider and validator as easy as possible and to provide support as needed.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Q&amp;A**&nbsp;  \\n  \\n**Q: A question for Julian\u2014What is the reason that it is difficult for enterprises to use Akash currently and how does Vix\u0113llo help?**  \\n  \\nA: Enterprises typically need invoices for their expense payments. If an enterprise company is going to have an expense for cloud compute, they often need to be able to pay in fiat\u2014and then to receive an invoice for that payment.&nbsp;  \\n  \\nVix\u0113llo is working to build a fiat on-ramp for Akash Network that will allow users to pay with a credit card (to be able to pay with fiat) and also to receive an invoice for their payment. They will accomplish this by working with several banks in Singapore.&nbsp;\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Overclock Labs is Hiring**  \\n  \\nAkash still has openings for a **Sr. Software Engineer (equivalent to an L7 at Google)**. We are focusing mainly on Kubernetes experience for this role and are willing to provide background and guidance on Blockchain as needed. This role will be integral to creating the architecture of the open cloud.  \\n  \\nWe are also actively searching for a **VP of Marketing**.  \\n  \\nIf you know someone who might be a good fit for either of these roles\u2014please reach out to us.

Cloudmos is also releasing an explorer for Akash Network, along with a price comparison tool.\\n\\n### Praetor&nbsp;\\n\\nPraetor is building an intuitive solution for providers on Akash Network, which will enable Akash providers to rapidly get up and running on the network. [Praetor is now called Akash provider console](https://provider-console.akash.network/)\\n\\n### Spheron\\n\\nSpheron is also building a tool to make deploying on Akash easy and intuitive. They also will offer multi-coin settlements.\\n\\n### Cosmos Directory\\n\\nCosmos Directory has also joined Akash. They offer a highly curated list of RPC servers for any of the Cosmos SDK chains and are fulfilling a real need for a project directory in the web3 space.\\n\\n### Dimokus ([@dimokus_vrn](https://twitter.com/Dimokus_vrn)) is running a VPN server on Akash for $0.18 per month.\\n\\nThis highlights the low-cost and flexibility of deploying on Akash Network, and begs the question: What other deployments are possible?\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1660944280-screen-shot-2022-08-19-at-5-24-23-pm.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Chia Launches Bladebit Disk Beta\\n\\nChia, a decentralized blockchain based on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Space and Time, launched its beta of Bladebit Disk\u2014which gives users even more flexibility when creating Chia plots.\\n\\nPlotting on Chia is a one-time process that requires significant computational resources to complete. Once the plot is created, it can be transferred to storage and farmed for five to seven years.\\n\\nIn initial testing, Andrew Mello (Head of Mining at Overlock Labs) discovered that Bladebit Disk scales exceptionally well on virtualized Kubernetes environments on Akash Network.\\n\\n## Bladebit Disk on Akash Network\\n\\nWithin eight hours of the beta launch, Bladebit Disk was available for the entire network via Cloudmos (formerly Akashlytics). This showcases the exceptional flexibility of Akash and the speed that new deployments can be made available to everyone on the network. In addition, Bladebit Disk is a very profitable workload for providers. It will generate $200-350 per month, per workload, at $0.15/plot cost on modern hardware (defined as CPUs, memory, and hard drives produced within the past three years).\\n\\nAny providers that want to upgrade to support this workload should feel free to reach out to us if they have questions.\\n\\n## Run Bladebit Disk Now on Akash Network\\n\\nThe fastest (and only) way to run Bladebit Disk right now is to deploy on Akash Network.\\n\\nFirst, launch Cloudmos (formerly Akashlytics) > Templates > Mining > Bladebit Disk.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Joao Luna on Akash\u2019s Terraform Integration\\n\\nLuna was inspired to integrate Akash with Terraform to make managing multiple workloads from both Akash and web2 providers easier. Given Terraform\u2019s status in the legacy cloud market, this integration will make it much easier for developers to begin to move workloads onto Akash Network\u2014while still managing everything from the same Terraform environment they are already running.\\n\\nLuna mentions that Akash\u2019s Terraform integration works best for:\\n\\n- Developers\\n- Operations Teams\\n\\nAnyone that has any feature requests or suggestions should feel free to head over to [Joao Luna\u2019s GitHub](https://github.com/cloud-j-luna/terraform-provider-akash), as his Terraform integration is open source.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Q&amp;A\\n\\n### Q: What problem does Akash Network solve?\\n\\nAkash Network is the first viable open cloud. The mission of the network is to decentralize the market for cloud compute. This will balance the market power of large cloud providers, as the market is currently controlled by an oligopoly of only three major providers.\\n\\nThere is also a widespread underutilization problem with cloud providers. Offering unused compute capacity on Akash helps providers maximize profitability for their resources.\\n\\n### Q: What is Akash\u2019s plan to onboard more people into the decentralized cloud?\\n\\nThe first step is improving the product so that it\u2019s easier for more people to use. Second, we will work with protocol clients to improve retention.\\n\\nWe will work to maximize market penetration within the Cosmos ecosystem (which includes RPC servers, node providers, and websites, among others). This initiative is going well.\\n\\nNext, we will move outward to the broader web3 community. We just beginning this work, and are already seeing traction.\\n\\nBeyond that, we will move into the high-performance computing market.\\n\\nOur goal for each of these phases is to offer a value proposition that cannot be found elsewhere. We aspire to offer a product that isn\u2019t offered anywhere else in Web2 or Web3.\\n\\n### Q: When will Akash be able to offer managed services?\\n\\nManaged services are something we would like to offer down the road, but for the immediate future, we are going to prioritize retention and our current roadmap.\\n\\n### Q: I know a few cloud service providers who would be interested in using Akash. Who should I have them connect with?\\n\\nWe would be happy to connect!

Here is a look back at our major milestones for July 2022.\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\n\\n**All-time high usage.** We reached several new all-time highs for usage in July\u2014including daily AKT spend, actively leased memory, and active providers.\\n\\n**Our team is growing.** Overclock Labs welcomed three new members to our team in July: Jorge Lopez Johnson, Sr. DevOps Engineer, Milos Nikolic, Sr. Software Engineer, and Zach Horn, Content Marketing Associate. We are still looking to fill several roles, especially engineering talent.\\n\\n**Opportunities for thought leadership.** Greg Osuri (CEO of Overclock Labs) and Anil Murty (Head of Product at Overclock Labs) are announced as speakers at Messari Mainnet from September 21-23 in New York City. Adam Bozanich (CTO of Overclock Labs) and Adam Wozney (Head of Community at Overclock Labs) are scheduled to speak at Cosmoverse, from September 26-28.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Record High Usage\\n\\nAkash reached a new record high for usage in July, peaking at over 11 terabytes of actively leased memory. We consider memory to be the most accurate measure of network usage, as it is the most valuable scarce resource on the network.\\n\\nDaily AKT spend also peaked in a similar time frame at over 1,100 AKT/day.\\n\\nAkash has more providers on the network than ever before. There are currently 57 active providers, and more providers are joining the network on a continual basis.\\n\\n## Akash Accelerator\\n\\nIn June, we refactored what was previously the Community Awards Board (CAB) into our new initiative, Akash Accelerator. Over the month of July, we have continued to build upon this foundation to bring new projects onto Akash Network, providing guidance, technical support, and grants to help these projects become operational and grow.\\n\\nAkash Accelerator also acts in an advisory capacity and ensures these projects are better prepared to raise money.\\n\\n### Our featured Akash Accelerator projects:\\n\\n[**Cloudmos (previously Akashlytics)**](https://cloudmos.io/)\\n\\nCloudmos provides network usage data for Akash Network. Cloudmos is also in the process of launching an explorer for Akash Network.\\n\\n[**Akash Provider Console**](https://provider-console.akash.network/)\\n\\nAkash Provider Console makes it easy to become a provider on Akash Network, offering an easy-to-use interface as an alternative to using the command-line interface (CLI).\\n\\n[**OpenRegistry**](https://app.openregistry.dev/)\\n\\nOpenRegistry is a decentralized registry of container images. Users can store, download, and share container images and the platform is Open Container Image (OCI) compliant.\\n\\n[**Moultrie Audits**](https://www.moultrieaudits.com/)\\n\\nMoultrie Audits is an infrastructure auditing company designed to increase technical security and uptime.\\n\\n## Greg Osuri and Anil Murty Announced as Speakers at Messari Mainnet\\n\\nAkash Network will be sponsoring Messari Mainnet from September 21-23 in New York City. Both Greg Osuri, CEO of Overclock Labs, and Anil Murty, Head of Product at Overclock Labs, will be speaking on panels alongside several other prominent companies in the web3 space.\\n\\nWe look forward to the opportunity to provide thought leadership to the industry around decentralization, peer-to-peer marketplaces, and the future of the cloud\u2014topics we believe in deeply.\\n\\n## Persistent Storage Now Available on Akash Network\\n\\nPraetor now offers persistent storage on Akash Network, offering even more flexibility to developers looking to run a wider variety of workloads. We have already heard from many developers that the availability of persistent storage was a major factor in the decision to move additional workloads onto Akash Network.\\n\\nDevelopers are using persistent storage across many different applications\u2014including running nodes and validators, databases, data warehousing, and machine learning.\\n\\n## Four-Phase Adoption Plan\\n\\nGreg Osuri reiterated our commitment to our four-phase plan for the adoption of Akash Network.\\n\\n**Phase One:** Increase adoption within the Cosmos Ecosystem &amp; web3.\\n\\n**Phase Two:** Increase adoption of compute-intensive workloads and add GPU support.\\n\\n**Phase Three:** Further increase adoption by decreasing latency and targeting the High-Performance Computing market.\\n\\n**Phase Four:** Maximize adoption around the world by onboarding web2 tenants and providers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe will release a similar recap for the month of August in a few weeks.

Use code **AKASH300** at checkout for $300 off of your ticket purchase.\\n    \\n*   Adam Bozanich (Co-Founder of Overclock Labs) and Adam Wozney (Head of Community at Overclock Labs) will be speaking at [Cosmoverse](https://cosmoverse.org/) in Medell\u00edn, Columbia between September 26-28.\\n    \\n\\nThe Ethos of a Validator\\n------------------------\\n\\nTodd provides his background as a validator and his journey to Cosmos. From both his and the community\u2019s perspectives, a validator is responsible for more than just making blocks. There is a responsibility to make the ecosystem better. One way to do that is by building tools that seek to answer a question.\\n\\nFor Todd, the genesis of his [Cosmissed](https://blockpane.com/projects.html) tool came from the question: \u201cWhy are people missing blocks?\u201d&nbsp;\\n\\nFrom this question, many more arose as the tool evolved. He notes that asking these seeking questions brings forward valuable information that makes it easier to build for the right audience. Greg agrees, having built many apps that started as a desire to fulfill a personal need. He says that even years later, he finds many of those apps very useful, and nostalgic in a way. Sometimes, those apps end up finding a wider audience.&nbsp;\\n\\nWhy Do Some Developers Continue to Choose web2 Cloud Providers?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is an interesting and complex topic that has been brought up by guests on previous Akash Weekly segments.\\n\\nThe answer, according to Todd (and echoed by previous guests), is that hyperscale cloud providers are familiar to many developers\u2014who often have deep experience with these platforms. Even though these legacy services may not be the best fit for certain projects, some developers continue to return to what they know.\\n\\nBut this is changing. Many developers are beginning to run their nodes and applications on decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces like Akash Network\u2014often achieving the same performance for a fraction of the cost.\\n\\nTodd mentions that he avoids running more than one validator in the same data center. This way, if there are outages, it reduces the impact of the problem. \u201cThis way I only have one problem, not six,\u201d he says. This is one way that developers can begin to spread out risk and achieve a semblance of decentralization. For those looking to achieve an even greater decentralization of their workloads, Akash Network makes it easy to deploy seamlessly across many different providers.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn addition, many developers have mentioned the addition of persistent storage on Akash Network as a key reason for moving more workloads over to Akash.\\n\\nA Scalable, Private Infrastructure Layer\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nOskar gives a run-through of Alter, which is a scalable, private infrastructure layer that supports web3 communities. They have focused on maintaining the highest security and privacy standards.\\n\\nAlter is focusing on decentralizing its file storage infrastructure, and working on ways to give users the most choice in controlling the security of their data. They are also exploring options to work with Akash to offer users more control and sovereignty over their data and communications.\\n\\n**Managing to GDPR.** Oskar notes that Alter is not subject to GDPR regulations because they do not process user data\u2014as all the data that Alter works with uses E2EE (End to End Encryption). This not only reduces Alter\u2019s regulatory burden but is also a function of the ways that Alter protects and preserves user privacy.\\n\\nAs Oskar notes, \u201cweb3 can only happen if we collaborate with each other. Otherwise, it is not possible to reach our common goal\u2014which is a decentralized web space.\\&quot;\\n\\nWhich Tools Does web3 Need Now?\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nweb3 is currently highly dependent on Github, which is owned by Microsoft. This centralized service becomes a single point of failure if there are outages, or if takedown notices are issued. Cloudflare also has a significant concentration of websites and applications.\\n\\nA major risk to the entire decentralization movement is the reliance on centralized cloud providers. Chainstack estimates that the top ten cloud providers of Ethereum nodes amount to nearly 60% of all nodes on the network. AWS alone hosts nearly 25% of all nodes on the network.\\n\\nReliance on centralized infrastructure poses significant risks to the stability and sovereignty of all systems and networks that aim to be decentralized. Based on this data from the Ethereum network\u2014an AWS outage would take down nearly a quarter of the entire network.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash provides the foundational layer that provides decentralization at the base layer. This opens the opportunity for developers to build applications on truly decentralized infrastructure, without having to sacrifice sovereignty by defaulting to hyperscale providers.\\n\\nQ&amp;A\\n---\\n\\n### Q: Are there plans to launch incentive programs with AKT?\\n\\nWe will have future plans to launch incentives, but there are no current plans. We are focusing on revamping our AKT tokenomics.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCheck out the full recording of this Akash Weekly on our YouTube channel.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri: Block Pane, Alter, and Developing for Decentralization&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri is our weekly community call hosted on Twitter Spaces.

If you are interested in becoming an Akash Insider to get access to the leading edge of the Akash Ecosystem, get more information at [akash.network/community](https://akash.network/community).\\n    \\n*   Check out our Akash Accelerator program if you have an idea for a project on Akash Network.\\n    \\n*   [Check out our recent AMA with Citadel.one](https://forum.akash.network/t/citadel-one-ama-recap/4636)\\n    \\n\\nUpdates from Greg Osuri\\n-----------------------\\n\\n### Recent Exploit of Slope Finance and The Importance of Open Source\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1659711571-screen-shot-2022-08-04-at-10-05-39-am.png)\\n\\nThe recent attack on Slope Finance highlights the importance of building open source software. [According to reporting from The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/161325/solana-team-traces-exploit-back-to-slope-mobile-wallets), a group of, \u201cdevelopers, ecosystem teams and security auditors\u201d called @SolanaStatus completed an independent investigation of the attack, tweeting:\\n\\n\u201cThis exploit was isolated to one wallet on Solana, and hardware wallets used by Slope \\\\[Finance\\\\] remain secure. While the details of exactly how this occurred are still under investigation, but private key information was inadvertently transmitted to an application monitoring service.\u201d \\\\[@SolanaStatus\\\\]\\n\\nAkash Network is open source, and we believe strongly in open source development\u2014which creates trust and confidence for Akash users.\\n\\nAnyone using a hot wallet should verify that the underlying code is open source. Closed source wallets present significant risks to users, and are especially vulnerable to hacks and exploits\u2014as we have seen in the case of Slope Finance.\\n\\n### Decentralized Cloud Adoption and Akash\u2019s Organic Growth\\n\\nAkash Network was recently featured in an article from [Rachel Wolfson at CoinTelegraph on the adoption of decentralized web services for web3](https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-storage-providers-power-the-web3-economy-but-adoption-still-underway). The piece focuses on the current state of the centralized internet, specifically on the dominance of the three largest cloud providers. Wolfson points to decentralized storage protocols like Filecoin and Storj, and of course, decentralized compute marketplaces like Akash Network as leading examples of web3 infrastructure.\\n\\nIn addition, Colin Pape, the CEO of Presearch, a decentralized search engine, highlighted that nodes on Presearch\u2019s network could be run using Akash. In addition, Pape mentioned that Presearch encourages nodes to be run on as many different platforms as possible to encourage decentralization, which is in line with Akash\u2019s ethos and functionality. Presearch currently has 70,000 nodes supporting its network.\\n\\nWe believe that bear markets are an excellent time to educate the market on the importance of decentralized infrastructure. Our message stands out as signal when the noise of token prices and NFT floors calms down. This is the time to speak clearly to long-term market participants\u2014the folks who are building in web3 for a decentralized future. We look forward to more features in the press and the healthy, organic adoption that it will bring.\\n\\n### Terraform Integration\\n\\nTerraform is the number one orchestrator for multi-cloud applications. Terraform makes it simple to deploy applications across different cloud providers. A new community-created Akash integration with Terraform makes it easy for developers to write a small script to move some of their resources over to Akash Network, which allows them to test Akash without the need to make an all-or-nothing decision. This is important for our business development efforts when we reach out to web2 developers.\\n\\nWe want to thank our incredible community for their continued development efforts and commitment to Akash Network.\\n\\n### Cosmos IBC Relayers\\n\\nInter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol on Cosmos works by relaying packets of information between blockchains, without taking custody of user assets. In this way, the security of the transfer is based on the security of the underlying blockchains. Relayers are not vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks and exploits that can happen with bridges.\\n\\nOur Guest this Week: George Jekner, CEO of Yieldmos\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGeorge Jekner is the CEO of Yieldmos, primarily responsible for strategy and back-end development. George has been a crypto enthusiast and a full-stack developer in the traditional finance sector for almost a decade. George was previously an IT consultant in the Chicagoland area for seven years.\\n\\nYieldmos provides a way for users to earn yield while maintaining custody of their funds. This is achieved by using AuthZ to delegate specific permissions so that Yieldmos can act on a user\u2019s behalf, but critically, Yieldmos does not take custody of user funds.\\n\\nGeorge offers an analogy to the way that a check works in the traditional finance system. A check grants a person permission to draw an exact amount of money from an account. In the same way, Yieldmos operates with specific permissions which are granted via AuthZ by the user\u2014this way, users can earn yield while maintaining custody of their funds.\\n\\nOur Panel this Week: Greg Osuri, George Jekner, and Scott \u201cHewi\u201d Hewitson\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**What is DeFi?**\\n\\nHewi offers a definition of Decentralized Finance (DeFi): \u201cAccess to financial products without a trusted third-party.\u201d&nbsp;\\n\\nContrasting DeFi against Centralized Finance (CeFi), the panel notes that DeFi products have continued functioning well despite the recent collapses of multiple centralized entities adjacent to the DeFi space\u2014notably Voyager, Celsius, and 3AC.&nbsp;\\n\\nGreg notes that this is a classic example of closed source failing to open source. DeFi protocols offer transparency that CeFi cannot. In DeFi, a user can see how their funds are being transferred. On-chain transactions allow the users and the wider industry to examine how a protocol is functioning. In this way, openness and transparency can put a check on bad actors and help to mitigate the risks of overleverage.\\n\\nThe panel agrees that DeFi is doing very well in terms of protecting users.\\n\\n**What is the importance of web3 protocols running on decentralized services?**\\n\\nGeorge Jekner offers his perspective on the current state of decentralization in web3. He notes that Yieldmos is striving to move fully into web3 but currently must use some web2 services to access the full tech stack they need. At the moment, web2 is a stepping stone to web3.\\n\\nGreg\u2019s perspective is that the primary issue is the overreliance on a single host. Relying on the largest cloud providers causes too much concentration of power. web3 companies and protocols should avoid running their applications on these massive cloud providers.\\n\\nAkash offers high security and high flexibility for developers - all within a decentralized environment.\\n\\nQ&amp;A from the Community\\n----------------------\\n\\n### Is there an ETA on Take Fees?\\n\\nWe are waiting for more regulatory clarity.\\n\\n### Does the protocol have a treasury?\\n\\nOverclock Labs (the creators of Akash Network) does have a treasury.&nbsp;\\n\\n### Will AKT tokenomics change?\\n\\nOne of our goals is to add stable settlement, as AKT is volatile. This applies especially to people looking for long-term hosting.\\n\\nWe are working to add a stable settlement mechanism using dynamic pricing. We are also working on early provider incentives to grow Akash Network. Stay tuned.\\n\\n### Is Keplr secure?\\n\\nKeplr is closed source, so Greg recommends the same best practices for security that a person would use with any wallet. Always move funds to a cold wallet for greater security.\\n\\n### Where kind we find a list of Akash Accelerator projects?\\n\\n[This page on our website lists our current accelerator projects.](https://akash.network/akash-accelerator)\\n\\n### Is there a plan for an APR boost?\\n\\nThere is no plan for an APR boost.\\n\\nConnect with Akash\\n------------------\\n\\n[_**Follow Akash Network (@akashnet\\\\_) on Twitter**_](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) _to stay up to date with Akash Network, AKT, and the Akash Community._\\n\\n[_**Join our Discord**_](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67) _to get involved with our community._\\n\\n_**Are you an Akash super user?**_ _Consider joining our_ [_Akash Insiders community_](https://akash.network/community?form=true#insiders) _to get access to the leading edge of the Akash ecosystem, and be among the first to see and test new features before anyone else._\\n\\n### Join our team\\n\\nWe currently have an opening for a VP of Marketing, and we are always looking for engineers.

We have seen users of Akash Network apply our infrastructure to participate in incentivized testnets, which lowers their costs and results in higher earnings.\\n\\nAkash user Pavlo Dereniuk (@PDereniuk) participated in an incentivized testnet and was able to deploy a node for only $4 using Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1659123850-screen-shot-2022-07-29-at-3-43-18-pm.png)\\n\\n### Akash is Recording Strong Growth Metrics\\n\\nAkash recorded its highest-ever resource usage in July, **peaking at 11 terabytes of actively leased memory**. Providers on Akash Network maintain a 29% utilization rate, which strongly indicates that Akash has a healthy product-market fit without any external incentives.\\n\\nAkash registered the highest Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) volume of any non-financial Web3 application.\\n\\n### Interchain Accounts Are Coming Soon\\n\\nInterchain accounts on Akash are code-ready on our GitHub and currently in review. The addition of interchain accounts will allow for interoperability between other chains like Juno and Akash Network. Once interchain accounts are live, Juno users will be able to deploy onto Akash using a Juno account \u2013 instead of an Akash account. This opens up the ecosystem and fundamentally changes the way that users interact with networks. Interchain accounts will also open composability use-cases between different application chains within the IBC ecosystem.\\n\\nIf you use Akash Network for your project or protocol, please consider displaying the Akash logo and sharing on social using #PoweredByAkash.\\n\\n### Work with Akash\\n\\nWe are continuing to expand the Akash team. In July, we welcomed eight new hires with two roles remaining to be filled \u2013 continuing toward the goal of expanding our team by 20%.\\n\\nAkash is still searching for two priority roles. If you, or someone you know, are interested in making the jump into web3 \u2013 please feel free to take a look at the open roles below:\\n\\n*   [Sr. Software Engineer](https://jobs.lever.co/AkashNetwork/ffb7576e-b9c4-450b-993e-226565dc236d)\\n    \\n*   [VP of Marketing](https://jobs.lever.co/AkashNetwork/02a876a8-8732-4e8c-a638-f696aeac027c)\\n    \\n\\nLooking Forward\\n---------------\\n\\n### GPU Marketplace\\n\\n[Messari\u2019s research article](https://messari.io/article/akash-solving-web3-s-centralization-problems) highlights Akash as a viable option for Ethereum miners to rent their GPUs in the future, post-merge. Akash aims to have that functionality ready by the time The Merge happens.\\n\\nOnce unlocked, GPU support on Akash will not only open the door for the next generation of Web3 games but will unlock unprecedented Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. This means that everyone will be able to run even more complex workloads without the fear of being de-platformed or censored.\\n\\nAs the world becomes digitized, we will see GPUs integrated into more aspects of our lives. Not just in computers but phones, gaming consoles, and yes, even Teslas. As Ethereum prepares to complete The Merge \u2013 more GPUs will hit the market as demand decreases post-merge.\\n\\n### IP Leases Functionality &amp; Release Progress\\n\\nIP leases allow Akash tenants to request static and publicly recognizable IP addresses for the applications and services they deploy.\\n\\nProviders typically control a pool of IP addresses, of which many are unused. Akash\u2019s IP Lease service allows providers to lease these unused IP addresses to users, which benefits the user\u2019s application and allows the provider to monetize their unused IP addresses.\\n\\nThe addition of IP leases gives users on Akash Network access to a service typically reserved for users of large cloud providers.\\n\\nIP Leases on Akash are currently live and deployed on a testnet, and we are working to get this service live as soon as possible.\\n\\nQ&amp;A Highlights\\n--------------\\n\\n### Q: Do you plan to implement a system where people can buy AKT with their credit card for deployments so that there is no need to go to an exchange?\\n\\n> \\&quot;Yes, we plan to offer credit card payments at some point in the future. We are investigating options and defining the work that would allow for the leasing of resources directly via credit cards, instead of having to purchase AKT.\\&quot;\\n> \\n> Anil Murty, Head of Product, Overclock Labs (Creator of Akash Network)\\n\\n### Q: What is the difference between Akash Network, Filecoin, and Arweave?\\n\\nThese are very different services, although the offerings may sound similar.\\n\\nFilecoin and Arweave offer data storage, which means that a user can store and retrieve static data without the expectation of running an application.\\n\\nAkash Network is a cloud computing service. This means that Akash allows developers to run applications in the cloud. As with any cloud computing service, the expectation is that once a user is finished running the application \u2013 the storage goes away. Even with persistent storage, data is maintained across different restarts but not permanently stored.\\n\\nCloud computing services like Akash Network and storage solutions like Filecoin and Arweave are complimentary. A developer would need to use both service types to create a fully decentralized web application.\\n\\n### Q: Will we see Greg and Lex on an Elden Ring livestream?\\n\\nPotentially! Stay tuned.\\n\\nConnect with Akash\\n------------------\\n\\nWe invite you to dive deeper into the original audio on our YouTube Channel.\\n\\n[_**Follow Akash Network (@akashnet\\\\_) on Twitter**_](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) _to stay up to date with Akash Network, AKT, and the Akash Community._\\n\\n[_**Join our Discord**_](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67) _to get involved with our community._\\n\\n_**Are you an Akash super user?**_ _Consider joining our_ [_Akash Insiders community_](https://akash.network/community?form=true#insiders) _to get access to the leading edge of the Akash ecosystem, and be among the first to see and test new features before anyone else._&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri: July 27, 2022&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly is our weekly community call hosted on Twitter Spaces.

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) to be notified when Akash Weekly's are live.\\n\\nOn this Spaces: CEO of Overclock Labs, Greg Osuri and Rebecca Liao, the Co-founder and CEO of Saga get together to go over the partnership between Saga and Akash, Ecosystem and AKT updates.\\n\\n#### **Saga Introduction**\\n\\nSaga is a protocol that allows developers to take a single-tenant VM and automatically launch it on a dedicated blockchain, complete with fully provisioned validators and an optimally incentivized security structure.\\n\\n#### **Akash Ecosystem Updates**&nbsp;\\n\\nAnother week, another all-time high of usage on Akash \ud83d\udd25.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657930634-unnamed-2.png)\\n\\n- The increased demand is attributed to our ongoing partnership with Chia. Read more about the Akash X Chia partnership, [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-adds-support-for-chia-network-301462805.html).\\n- Greater demand signals increasing utility being discovered.\\n\\n### Provider Updates\\n\\n- Praetor App's success with onboarding new providers results in Akash's highest active provider counts to date.\\n- There are now _**44 active providers**_ on Akash with a high fill rate, which means they are profitable and encouraging more providers to join our network.\\n\\n### Inter-chain Accounts are Ready\\n\\n- ICA opens up new interoperability options within the Cosmos ecosystem. Read more about that, [here](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-accounts-take-cosmos-interoperability-to-the-next-level-39c9a8aad4ad).\\n- Usecase Example: Juno DAO can spin up Akash services and pay for them using native JUNO tokens.\\n- Usecase Example: Secret Network can offer ownerless deployments where you won\u2019t necessarily need to disclose who the owner is when Akash is being used with Secret.\\n\\n### Powered By Akash is on the Rise\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657908793-unnamed-1.png)\\n\\n#### **Guest Highlight: Saga**\\n\\nSaga is a Cosmos SDK-based chain that is deploying application blockchains as a service. Using interchain security, Saga gives developers all the benefits of having their own block space without having to set up their own network of validators themselves. The whole process can be done as easily as deploying a smart contract.\\n\\n- Option to automatically set up their own dedicated chains.\\n- Gas fees can be set by the developers and are predictable because the users are not sharing block space with a bunch of other applications that they have no control over.\\n\\n### **Synergies for Akash and Saga**\\n\\nSaga is a shared state chain that enables rapid startup of new chains. In terms of being able to supply the processing capacity to power the chain. Greg believes Akash really helps in terms of being able to provide the computation to power the chain. Users will no longer be required to have a separate account and will not need to go out of their existing community in order to buy AKT to use computing on the Akash Network.\\n\\nSaga wants its validators to have automatic access to the computing power that Akash can provide. The composability and inter-chain accounts also open a big opportunity for future collaborations.\\n\\nBelow is a quick outline of topics discussed, we invite you to dive deeper into the original recap here on our YouTube Channel.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri: July 13, 2022&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly is a regular effort hosted via Twitter Spaces to update our community about the ins and outs of Akash Network\u2019s developments.

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/akashnet_) to be notified when Akash Weekly\u2019s are live.\\n\\nOn this Spaces: CEO of Overclock Labs, Greg Osuri, and Anil Murty, the Head of Product at Overclock Labs go over ecosystem updates, product updates, and the Akash adoption plan, phase by phase.\\n\\n### **Introduction**&nbsp;\\n\\n[Anil Murty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilmurty/) is our new Head of Product at Overclock Labs. He is an Engineer turned Product Manager who has a passion for building products that serve deeply-technical users. He's worked on products, ranging from consumer hardware, enterprise hardware, software, SaaS, and most recently cloud-native developer and observability tooling.\\n\\nPrior to Akash, Anil worked on cloud-native products at Hashicorp where he was involved with building products for people that are monitoring their services running on the cloud; relevant experience that will help bring Akash forward.\\n\\n### **Ecosystem Updates**\\n\\nAkash hits a new record with adoption, seeing an all-time high in resource utilization and AKT expenditure \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657299165-unnamed-1.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657299233-unnamed-2.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657299286-unnamed-3.png)\\n\\nWe attribute this uptick to our partnership with the Chia Project, a new blockchain and smart transaction platform, as well as the $0.10 plots on Akash, currently offered as a part of our Summer Sale. This is a steal compared to the $0.40 plots often found using traditional cloud services.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657299368-unnamed-4.png)\\n\\nThe Praetor App streamlined provider deployments, and it now includes persistent storage. Persistent storage, as a newer feature on the Akash Network, is still somewhat expensive simply because there aren't enough providers who currently offer it. Praetor is continuing to come up with innovative ways that simplify persistent storage enablement on Akash and we anticipate more and more providers offering this feature in near future. To learn more about Praetor App, click [here](https://youtu.be/M6-8x4WUMjo). [Praetor is now called Akash provider console](https://provider-console.akash.network/)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657300118-unnamed-5.png)\\n\\n### **Proposals of Akash Community**\\n\\n- Proposal 22 seeks to fund Moultrie Audits, an infrastructure auditing development group focused on decentralized Cosmos SDK protocols. View the full proposal, [here](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/22).\\n- Proposal 23 will officially transition the Community Awards Board to the Akash Accelerator. View the full proposal, [here](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/23).\\n- Proposal 24 is a vote on funding for Akash Accelerator. View the full proposal, [here](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/24).\\n\\n### **Akash Product Updates**\\n\\n- IP Leases will go live later this month, allowing providers to provide static IPs that you can tie to your services, expanding the use cases of Akash Network.\\n- Akash is currently undergoing a major restructuring of the code that takes care of onboarding for new providers, ultimately making it easier to troubleshoot provider issues.\\n- Akash Network is looking into a sandbox environment for developers. This would be something that you can integrate and test with Akash without having to deploy or spend any AKT.\\n- We\u2019ve begun work on the final product plan on how to support GPUs on Akash Network over the next few months.\\n- Akash Console (in the works) is a user interface that will be completely web-based and low-friction, making it possible for both technical and non-technical users to use Akash, thus lowering the barrier to entering the world of Web3.\\n\\n### **Adoption Plans**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1657300163-unnamed-6.png)\\n\\nAs outlined above, phase one focuses on attracting our immediate community, Cosmos users, and then Web3 communities at large. We chose to target Cosmos users initially because they already understand and are engrained in the ecosystem. This allows us to provide value to them immediately while validating our model for adoption. If you look at the [ecosystem page](http://44ft4f31u1dipf9g689u3hm7lg.ingress.provider-0.prod.ams1.akash.pub/) made by our community (thanks, Akashians!), you see top Cosmos projects within DEX, NFT, and gaming vertices like Osmosis, Strangeclan, and more, that are choosing Akash Network over Amazon.\\n\\nPhase 2 will be focused on data-intensive applications because, in general, it's extremely expensive to run GPUs on the cloud. Sourcing the underutilized GPUs, once the Ethereum merge happens, is going to be a major milestone and proof point as a unique value proposition that Akash can provide to the world.\\n\\nPhase 3, once we solve for cost, we plan to move to the performance. We plan to enhance performance by expanding our network reach from the 35 providers we have now to hundreds, and then thousands over multiple regions to cover a larger footprint than the current, centralized cloud providers can do. Akash is building something fundamentally different - we are not building data centers, people with data centers come to us and at some point, Akash will be the fastest network because of this coverage.\\n\\nPhase 4 is mass adoption. Once you have the fastest performance at the lowest cost, along with product and service layers complete, we can create a very compelling argument for Web2 to make the jump over to the decentralized cloud through Akash.\\n\\nBelow is a quick outline of topics discussed, we invite you to dive deeper into the original recap here on our YouTube Channel.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly with Greg Osuri: July 6, 2022&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Weekly Spaces is a regular effort hosted via Twitter Spaces to update our community about the ins and outs of Akash Network\u2019s developments.

They have created a tiered auditing system, are the only active community auditors, and have developed one-click auditing. This means you can set up your provider via an onboarding tool like Praetor, and get your provider audited, all without ever having to come in contact with Moultrie. This reduces the barriers to entry for individuals and entities looking to increase their security in the Web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nThe Moultrie Audits team is an infrastructure auditing development group focused on decentralized Cosmos SDK protocols.\\n\\nA blockchain-based decentralized web is shattering centralized monopolies that control information, access, money, and how networks work. Furthermore, Web3 has created new interconnected economies, new asset classes and products, including new decentralized services online. As Web3 re-democratizes the web, this will define the next era of the internet. Akash plays a key role in this process.\\n\\nAkash Network is the world's first distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute that provides a fast, efficient, and low-cost application deployment solution. Developers leveraging Akash Network can access cloud computing at a fraction of the cost compared to centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.\\n\\n### The Moultrie Audits Team\\n\\nMoultrie Audits is composed of former Department of Defense (DoD) software engineers, network architects, and penetration testers. Moultrie Audits team members have achieved government compliance for 17 applications and led 7 applications into production, including 3 artificial intelligence applications used in hostile environments. The project lead, Anthony Rosa, also received a DoD award for cooperative work with the NSA on cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThe Moultrie Audits team\u2019s dive into Web3 work began in 2019 with content creation in the Tezos ecosystem,&nbsp; leading to community awards from TezosCommons. Team members then built ERC20 and BEP20 tokens for pay before exploring the application possibilities of cryptocurrency in the DoD. Hedera Hashgraph was integrated into applications and the team saw potential in Akash as a way to make government infrastructure more resilient. Not only was Akash useful for short-term, anonymous test deployments, but it could also be used as a fast-flux defense tactic, utilizing the compute power of individuals to defend against attacks on prominent infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Moultrie team was responsible for multiple deployments within the first 100 active deployments on the Akash Network. At this time, Akashlytics had not launched and the CLI and Tom Beynon\u2019s Docker deploy method were the only available options. Understanding the technical limitations of some users, and the developer-focused posture of Akash, Moultrie began making tutorials for deployment. They created poweredbyakash.com as a single place for users to view public projects on Akash, find tutorials, or download free simple code paired with guides. The tutorials are currently being updated to reflect the newer deployment methods and capabilities of the Akash ecosystem.\\n\\nNaturally, some community members needed additional support for more complex deployments, so Moultrie helped members through Telegram. This caught the eye of the Akash team members who proposed Moultrie to support the onboarding of larger clients on Akash. Thus, Project Phoenix was born, which was a 3-month event resulting in 33 sites being built and 12 projects/apps/companies actively adopting Akash. Project Phoenix was also the original point of contact for Rango Exchange, a decentralized exchange utilizing Akash.\\n\\nAfter Project Phoenix\u2019s success, and given the Moultrie team\u2019s background in infrastructure auditing, the Akash team reached back out and propositioned Moultrie to design an auditing system for providers. The Moultrie team agreed and recognized the importance of such an undertaking. Without an audited, verified system, gaining regulatory, governmental and institutional adoption would be a difficult undertaking. 6 months later, Moultrie Audits has operational three-tiered auditing and is capable of dozens of concurrent audits, scaling to meet the growing provider set thanks to ecosystem partner, Praetor.\\n\\n### Tiered Audits\\n\\nMoultrie Audits has designed and launched a three-tier auditing system (bronze, silver, gold) to allow for variance in provider capabilities, security, and financial resources. Onboarding begins through our website, email, or via Praetor. For intrusive audits which require sensitive Information, a Right-to-Audit contract is drafted and signed by the provider, data custodian, and company representative. Moultrie then tailors our audit to the provider\u2019s configuration, creates a lightweight agent for the provider to deploy on their controller, and begins trial deployments. Depending on the level of audit, these deployments undergo testing.\\n\\nMoultrie has custom task lists, Security Configuration Assessments, uptime metrics from global positions, and regulatory compliance frameworks including NIST 800-53 and PCI DSS. This also includes the ability to provide MITRE ATT&amp;CK reports. The first phase of the audit lasts 2-4 weeks before a full report is generated for the provider with all issues discovered, explanations, and remediation steps. Moultrie provides support for implementing these controls throughout the audit.\\n\\nOnce issues have been fixed, Moultrie conducts a second review period to give them a chance to prove the remediation of discovered issues. If the team passes this second review, a cryptographic signature is awarded corresponding to the level of audit conducted. Moultrie publishes all signed providers on their public tracker and offers continued support and periodical testing of signed providers. Providers with signatures can then be searched for by clients through manifests, and our signatures are included in the Akashlytics Deploy tool.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1656438660-code.png)\\n\\nTo see Moultrie\u2019s signatures in Akashlytics, click [here](https://github.com/Akashlytics/akashlytics-deploy/blob/master/auditors.json).\\n\\nTo visit Moultrie\u2019s public tracker, click [here](https://www.moultrieaudits.com/).\\n\\n### One-Click Audits\\n\\nPeople adopt cryptocurrency protocols for different reasons. From a technical perspective,&nbsp;blockchain is rarely, if ever, the most efficient solution for a computer problem. Crypto-evangelists are using blockchain for other reasons, namely for inherent privacy,&nbsp;decentralization, security, and resiliency. However, not everyone assigns these traits intrinsic value, and many place convenience and user experience at the top of their value hierarchy.\\n\\nThis is why Moultrie Audits is launching one-click bronze audits in conjunction with Praetor.&nbsp;Praetor provides a seamless onboarding experience for providers who simply need to input publicly accessible information before clicking \u201caudit,\u201d and Moultrie handles the rest.&nbsp;One-click audits are important for three reasons. First, if the auditing process is difficult, expensive, or cumbersome, providers will simply ignore optional audits. The easier the&nbsp;process, the more provider involvement, and the more security for tenants. Second, a major benefit of Akash is its potential to unlock the compute capacity of individuals.\\n\\nThese individuals don\u2019t have the resources for institutional-grade security, so the bronze audit is a way to verify basic security for lower-level deployments. This will increase decentralization in the provider set through equitable auditing opportunities without ostracizing smaller providers. Lastly, when tenants deploy, the most important thing is that the product works, aka that the provider hosts the website properly and reliably. Additionally, less secure providers are cheaper to operate, and not all deployments require high security. Tenants should have the option to consciously purchase less security for a better rate. A one-click audit offers a good balance between convenience, accommodating tenant choice, and verifying basic security and high uptime.\\n\\n### Government Grade Standards\\n\\nSince the Moultrie Audits team comes from a US government background, they placed utmost importance on providers meeting US standards for hosting, even if some of the obligations appear arcane or irrelevant. To meet these high standards, Moultrie Audits developed custom task lists from experience in the DoD which run configuration checks for Security Configuration Assessments (Operating System dependent best practices) and regulatory compliance frameworks, such as PCI DSS (payment regulations), GDPR (European privacy rules), and HIPAA. They also use the open-source lightweight agent, Wazuh, to provide a redundant set of checks on controller configurations and for their SCA module which provides an engine to run tests in YAML format.\\n\\nMoultrie\u2019s penetration model is based upon the DoD\u2019s Team Rocket, which conducts penetration testing on applications and infrastructure once the software passes static and end-to-end tests.\\n\\nQuestionnaires with verification are required for audits higher than bronze to test for aspects of the provider which are not possible to verify through software. These are focused on physical security and check for physical servers with locked access, a security monitoring system with alerts, redundant power, redundant cooling, redundant network connections, and physical firewalls.\\n\\nGovernment and high-level clients also typically require uptime and failover service level agreements, which set standards for performance and resiliency from hosting infrastructure. Moultrie has never seen downtime higher than 30 minutes/year in a contract, and so for Moultrie\u2019s Gold Audit, they require 99.999% uptime which equates to 5 minutes and 15 seconds of downtime/year. Historically, 70% of federal agencies have still failed to meet this requirement, so a Gold Audit from Moultrie will provide reassurance to agencies looking to minimize downtime and optimize costs. For the Silver Audit, Moultrie enforces 99.9% uptime, or sub 9 hours/year downtime, and Bronze Audits require 99% uptime for lower-level deployments or sub 4 days/year downtime. Uptime checks are sent from Moultrie-controlled systems throughout the US and utilize Site24x7 for global checks from Amsterdam, NL, Manila, PH, Manama, BH, Montreal, CA, and Hong Kong, HK. Since the Akash Network tenants are a global consumer base, providers must meet uptime requirements from all locations to pass an audit.\\n\\n### Revenue Model\\n\\nFunding from grants is the most desirable funding method for any organization as it provides immediate funds without equity loss and few, if any, legal obligations. However, it is incredibly important to have a sustainable and independent revenue model, especially during bear markets. Moultrie Audits is particularly well-positioned to capitalize on a revenue model as there is a clear transactional relationship between an auditor and an auditee. The auditee, which is the provider, desires the security improvements, long-term support, performance statistics, and elevated signatures that Moultrie provides. These extended benefits are worth the one-time auditing fee. Moultrie Audits has successfully implemented the pay-per-audit business model and received 5 payments for audits. The team uses these profits to cover operating expenses and proceeds to provide subsequent audits free of charge.\\n\\nMoultrie Audits intends to submit requests for funds in the future. This will ensure audits are free for providers and will help fund experimental future auditing programs, such as validator auditing. If funding proves difficult, they plan to remain operational due to their proven business model. The Akash community should expect this from all projects: no one should be existentially reliant on funding. Furthermore, Moultrie has an active validator that can generate profits from delegators who value their work.\\n\\n### &nbsp;Moultrie Audits Validator\\n\\nMoultrie Audits launched its provider in December 2021, and are currently ranked 53rd/100 in terms of voting power. They have a competitive 5% commission, and 100% uptime, and have voted on all 5 governance proposals put forward since joining the active validator set. One of Moultrie Audits\u2019 validator sentries is also powered by Akash, allowing infrastructure on the network to secure the underlying chain. This takes value accrual from validator service payments and feeds them directly into the network, creating circular growth.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1656442124-unnamed-2.png)\\n\\nMoultrie Audits originated Proposal #16 in February 2022 which passed with ~82% \u201cyes\u201d votes in March 2022. They also originated Proposal #20 in June 2022, and plan on originating Proposal #21 immediately after the voting period for Proposal #20. This makes Moultrie Audits one of the top 5 active validators in originating governance on the network. Moultrie also advertised a policy to not sell any validator rewards for all of 2022 and they have followed through on that promise.\\n\\nIn addition to originating governance, Moultrie Audits has written blogs analyzing the effects of the different governance proposals. For Proposal #14, which expanded the validator set from 85 to 100, Moultrie tested whether the voting power would actually decentralize from the preexisting prevote threshold distribution, and checked other arbitrary voting power distribution changes. Moultrie also published data on the effects of Proposal #9 and Proposal #16 which funded the Akash Community Awards Board and documented the tremendous impact that the Akash Accelerator-funded projects have had on the network.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1656442163-unnamed-3.png)\\n\\nTo read Moultrie Audits\u2019 Blog, click [here](https://www.moultrieaudits.com/blog).\\n\\n### Effects of Audits\\n\\nThe most important part of Moultrie Audits is whether an increase in security leads to tangible, and not just philosophical, benefits. On average, getting audited correlates to an increased average deployment count for providers. Providers with a Moultrie Audits signature (2124 EST 01JUNE2022) have an average of 43 active deployments, ~286% more than ones without a signature (~15). This benefits the provider financially and encourages more providers to enter the network, seeing a greater potential profit opportunity.\\n\\nBeyond the individual provider, auditing from Moultrie is a risk-offloading vector for Akash. There is a conflict of interest between the managing organization attempting to grow its adoption while simultaneously acting as the regulator. Centralization is undesirable for cryptocurrencies and web3, as it undermines the security of the decentralized system. Additionally, audits of any sort will never guarantee 100% security; zero-day attacks may occur and breaches are inevitable. Adding the complexity of remote auditing to physical infrastructure only increases the risks of auditor error. It is beneficial to the Akash community that partners like Moultrie bring such expertise to the decentralized cloud, and are fully aligned with the greater web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n### Other Moultrie Projects\\n\\nFollowing the mnemonic self-exposure of HitBTC's DVPN wallet and subsequent loss of significant user funds, Moultrie developed a 24x7 block monitoring system to check for exposed mnemonics in real time. With the help of the Akash team, Moultrie also accessed the historical block data stored in a database and recovered all available funds associated with exposed accounts. The Moultrie team published articles on this process back in December 2021, but removed them due to the confusion that this was an Akash security vulnerability, when in fact it was a user error associated with a misunderstanding of the transaction parameters. Moultrie continues to monitor the Akash Network and recovers user funds when able, always free of charge. The Moultrie team has returned thousands of AKT back to vulnerable users, and released block data in collaboration with the Akash team during each instance of recovery. Recently, a community member was kind enough to publicly acknowledge Moultrie for recovering and returning his funds in full:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1656441512-unnamed-1.png)\\n\\nMoultrie continues to help onboard projects to the Akash ecosystem, continuing efforts from Project Phoenix. If a team is interested in migrating to Akash, Moultrie sets up a front end of their website/application as a demonstration of how to deploy, and then helps the team transition the rest of their architecture. Demand for the Akash Network's resources is the most important metric to track for the sustainability of the ecosystem and Moultrie will always support this effort. One of these post-Project Phoenix clients is a blogger and creator of Nederlandse Spreker, Joel Benson, who publicly attested to Moultrie's support in his journey through Web3.\\n\\n> \u201cAnthony at Akash Audit helped me tremendously with figuring out how to get The Conceptualist and some of my personal websites onto Akash. Super happy to see my websites hosted on a decentralized platform!\u201d \u2013\\n>\\n> Joel Benson, Founder of The Conceptualist Journal and Nederlandse Spreker\\n\\nMoultrie Audits also created and manages [poweredbyakash.com](http://poweredbyakash.com), a website dedicated to tracking projects who publicly utilize Akash. It currently contains 52 websites and applications. There is also a guides section with 7 guides involving the adoption and usage of Akash. Finally, we added a codepacks section to include free code of static websites that beginners can \\&quot;plug and play\\&quot; their information into for a quick, customizable blog or linktree website. Both codepacks come with a step-by-step deployment guide. The projects listed on [poweredbyakash.com](http://poweredbyakash.com) are not inclusive of all deployments, and this is to be expected.\\n\\nSome deployments are redundant instances for resiliency. Another massive benefit of Akash is the ability to anonymously deploy, and while the network is still young, exposing hosting solutions can add additional risk. [poweredbyakash.com](http://poweredbyakash.com) continues to receive attention and engagement from the community with a combined 591 pulls on dockerhub, and 5,000+ requests in the past 30 days (May/June 2022).\\n\\nMoultrie plans to expand [poweredbyakash.com](http://poweredbyakash.com) to other Cosmos SDK projects and has created cosmostutorials.com for this purpose. These are side projects for Moultrie's small team, but are updated frequently. Altogether, Moultrie's sites received 67,000 requests in the past 30 days (May/June 2022), driving significant attention toward the Akash ecosystem.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1656441699-unnamed.jpeg)\\n\\nMoultrie Audits is now exploring a validator auditing program to complement their provider auditing program. With the implosion of the Terra ecosystem, and the cascading insolvencies of various crypto-related projects, the US Treasury has signaled intent to begin regulating certain projects by the end of 2022. Sooner or later, validators will fall within sight of regulators, and Cosmos projects need to be prepared. Moultrie is uniquely qualified to undertake this due to the team's familiarity with regulatory compliance, proven Web3 auditing experience, and relationship with government agencies. Further applications for validator auditing could include tracking sales and foundation delegations and displaying this information in a consumable manner for prospective stakers. This public accountability system incentivizes community-oriented behavior from validators and disincentivizes dumping or unethical behavior.\\n\\nMoultrie Audits also has an active member on the Akash Community Awards Board (CAB), now the Akash Accelerator Program, a community effort to fund and incubate projects which add value to the Akash Network. The Akash Accelerator meets once a month for presentations and deliberation. In addition to submitting governance proposals, Moultrie has also contributed private funds, along with other CAB members, to support developers who want to use Akash, but don\u2019t necessarily contribute to the growth of the overall ecosystem.\\n\\nFinally, Moultrie intends to create a DAO to lead auditing innovation while simultaneously decentralizing the organization.\\n\\n> \u201cSince the overarching goal of Moultrie Audits is to increase the amount of scalable security solutions, we need to remain malleable and open to change. Implementing community governance from active/invested parties will give the community the chance to direct our future, the way crypto-governance intended.\u201d\\n>\\n> \u2013 Moultrie Team\\n\\n### Overall Impact\\n\\nAs of June 16th, 2022, Moultrie Audits has signed 5 providers and is actively auditing 24 others. With 11 currently predicted to pass, over 50% of providers with a signature will have one from Moultrie. This means Moultrie will be the most active auditor on the Akash Network, the only active auditor outside of the Akash team, and one of the most active governing validators on the network, all while delivering content that draws thousands of eyes to Akash-related content every month.\\n\\n### Call-to-Action\\n\\nTo learn more about Moultrie Audits, click [here](https://www.moultrieaudits.com).\\n\\nTo join Moultrie Audits\u2019 Discord Channel, click [here](https://discord.gg/hsMvYrd2).\\n\\nTo learn more about Akash, click [here](https://www.akash.network/).\\n\\nCollection: Overclock Labs, Akash Case Studies on Validators and Web3 Adoption\\n\\nPerspectives: Web3, Innovation &amp; Design, Decentralization, Blockchain, Governance, Technology and Operations.\\n\\nContributors: Moultrie Audits\\n\\nCitation: Yale University, COWLES FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS.

For starters, they have improved the Akash provider onboarding experience by reducing onboarding time by over 83%. This means you can become an Akash provider/host in 20 minutes or less. This reduces the barrier to entry for individuals and entities looking to join the Web3 revolution.\\n\\nThe Praetor team is a Web3 and blockchain application development group focused on decentralized applications that further the evolution of the internet.\\n\\nA blockchain-based decentralized web is shattering centralized monopolies that control information, access, money, and how networks work. Furthermore, Web3 has created new interconnected economies, new asset classes and products, including new decentralized services online.

Developers leveraging Akash Network can access cloud computing at a fraction of the cost compared to centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.\\n\\n### The Praetor Team&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Praetor team is a diverse group of experienced developers spanning enterprise, mobility, and blockchain applications. Having developed applications spanning CRM and Supply Chain Management (etc) systems across the US, Canada, India and beyond, their foray into Web3 began in 2021 with Uniwhales.\\n\\nInitially attempting to set up a provider machine on Akash Network, the team experienced difficulties due to the complex nature of Kubernetes, customization related to Akash, and process through heavy technical documentation.\\n\\nIt took almost two working days for the team to become a provider on Akash by following the documents. Still, when they became a provider, they faced some challenges in getting the bids. For example, they had to figure out why their deployments stayed \\&quot;pending\\&quot; once they started getting offers. In addition, from Akash Network's discord chat, the team learned that users could get confused about what values to set in some fields to become a provider. So, if the team can streamline becoming a provider process, they can hide some steps to make it less complicated for users.\\n\\nThe team noticed that the command-line interface is not everyone's forte, but it would be easy for users to understand the process from a graphical user interface point of view. They can also enforce some validations to mitigate the errors users make in becoming a provider through the application.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1655395877-unnamed-1.png)\\n\\n### Improving the Akash&nbsp;Host/Provider Onboarding&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;\\n\\nPraetor team noticed that to become a&nbsp;cloud provider, after having an Akash&nbsp;compatible Kubernetes cluster, the final&nbsp;step is to set up the provider service&nbsp;consisting of about eight to nine different&nbsp;stages and is very complicated for an&nbsp;average user to understand. So, the team first streamlined the process to make it easy&nbsp;for those with the Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\nThe first version of the application came out&nbsp;in March 2022, where the user provides&nbsp;their server access and the Akash wallet,&nbsp;which they want to use to become a provider. They also need to give the ingress domain, which will be responsible for hosting their deployer's URLs. This minimal information and better UX made it simple for users to become providers.\\n\\n> \\&quot;What Akashlytics did to simplify deploying apps on Akash Network, Praetor App, will streamline the onboarding of cloud providers. It is a massive undertaking, and it's a beautiful app to further contribute to network growth and adoption.\\&quot;\\n>\\n> Boz Menzanji, COO of Overclock Labs\\n\\n### Host/Provider Onboarding in 20 Minutes or Less&nbsp;\\n\\nBefore the solution provided by the Praetor team, the user would have to spend lots of time understanding how to set up the Kubernetes cluster. Then, they need to figure out the customization of their Kubernetes cluster to make it compatible with the Akash Network. The final step would be to set up a Provider service, which will be responsible for communicating with the blockchain to bid on leases, receive manifests, and close leases. The average processing time for a user to become a provider was more than two days.\\n\\nBy introducing the Praetor App, the provider onboarding experience has changed dramatically. The user does not need complex command-line interface knowledge. Instead, the user only needs their servers with an operating system. Praetor app takes care of installing the production-grade Kubernetes cluster, making it Akash ready, and setting up the provider service in just 20 minutes.\\n\\n> \u201cPraetor is unequivocally the easiest way to create a secure, network-ready provider and has been a key partner for Moultrie Audits and the growth of the Akash ecosystem.\u201d\\n>\\n> Moultrie Audits\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1655396113-unnamed-2.png)\\n\\n### Akash Provider Profitability Calculator&nbsp;\\n\\nUse this calculator to calculate how much you will earn if you provide your compute power to Akash using the most recent Osmosis price for AKT to USD calculation.\\n\\nOnce the team released the Praetor App, where an average user can come and create the Kubernetes cluster and provide it as a host on the Akash Network, the users were not clear about what prices to set for the bid price scale CPU, RAM and Disk they provide. Some users raised questions in both Akash's and Praetor's discord channel regarding pricing and bidding. On multiple occasions, both teams provided them with complex pricing calculations which in many cases required a high cognitive load to understand, leading to some users not completing the onboarding process.\\n\\nAt that point, the Praetor team decided to build and deploy to the community a calculator which they could easily understand and make informed decisions about what they needed to set as bid engine prices for CPU, RAM and Disk.\\n\\nTo learn more about how much you can earn while providing resources to Akash Network, click [here](https://akash.network/pricing/provider-calculator/).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1655396318-unnamed-3.png)\\n\\n### Akash Provider Real-Time Status Dashboard&nbsp;\\n\\nWhen the Praetor team first became a host-provider using the command-line interface, they wanted to know the standing of their host and compare it with other online host providers.\\n\\nThe only available tools to enable this level of visibility was via the CLI (Command Line Interface) which provided them with all the provider's information regardless of status (active vs. inactive). Furthermore, the team also found that users can get information about a particular provider's active, available and pending resources and active lease count. Though this&nbsp;information was available, presenting the information in an accessible, user-friendly manner was not available at the time. So, the Praetor team decided to provide a solution where the public could see real-time current Akash Host Provider information and available resources in real-time.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1655396443-unnamed-4.png)\\n\\nIt is also helpful to the deployers who wish to deploy their application using any available providers beforehand.&nbsp;To learn more about it, click [here](https://provider-console.akash.network/). [Praetor is now called Akash provider console](https://provider-console.akash.network/)\\n\\n### Becoming an Akash Validator&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Praetor team has demonstrated both technical and functional capabilities with a UX - first approach. This expertise, led by Jigar and Deval, coupled with increased adoption and engagement across the Akash ecosystem, led to inclusion in the Akash Validator program. The team was awarded a delegation and are now a part of the Akash Active Validator Set.\\n\\n> \u201cWe understand that being a validator comes with great responsibility. Mining blocks for a network is a 24x7 job. We understood the importance of reliability and did not miss any blocks since we are in the active validator set. Also, taking part in network upgrades and responsible voting on all proposals is equivalently important. It enables us to establish a more engaged connection with community members and the Akash ecosystem.\u201c\\n>\\n> Jigar\\n\\nWhat makes Praetor unique within the Akash ecosystem is the level of active engagement, coupled with the team's resolve to utilize Akash in their dApp deployments in its entirety, and running their validator node(s) on Akash. This full-cycle utilization is what demonstrates Jigar and Deval\u2019s commitment to the Akash ecosystem, Cosmos, and the Web3 revolution as a whole. While it\u2019s not unusual to see Web3 projects still running on centralized Web2 platforms, Praetor demonstrates a full commitment to the evolution of the internet via full utilization of the Akash platform end to end.\\n\\nThe team had a running RPC node for Akash Network before setting up the Validator. It helped them understand the job of sentry nodes and how to set up a DDoS prevention mechanism for their Validator node. On top of it, the Praetor team took multiple measures to secure their nodes and protect the funds of their delegators.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1655396690-unnamed-5.png)\\n\\n### Overall Results&nbsp;\\n\\nIn 2021, over 34,000 developers globally contributed code to open-source Web3 projects. In 2022, this number has almost more than doubled.\\n\\nThe Akash ecosystem is an engaged and expanding ecosystem with new projects joining daily. The Praetor team has also been onboarding new host providers, in addition to increasing their visibility across the Akash and Cosmos ecosystems. Furthermore, the Praetor team now also manages other providers in a managed services capacity. The growing ecosystem also brings with it a growing list of service offerings related to Web3.\\n\\n### Call-to-Action&nbsp;\\n\\nTo learn more about Akash provider console, click [here](https://provider-console.akash.network/).\\n\\nTo learn more about Akash, click [here](https://akash.network).\\n\\nCollection: Overclock Labs, Akash Case Studies on Validators and Web3 Adoption.\\n\\nPerspectives: Web3, Innovation &amp; Design, Decentralization, Blockchain, Governance, Technology and Operations.\\n\\nSuggested Citation: Harvard Business Review: Thomas Stackpole, Reid Blackman, Ramsey Khabbaz, Jonathan Ruane, Andrew McAfee, Ana Andjelic, Li Jing, Katie Parrott: Welcome to Web3, May 24, 2022.\\n\\nAcknowledgment: This case study is the first in a series of case studies on Web3, Blockchain Validators, Governance Frameworks and User Adoption from Overclock Labs.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How to Become an Akash Provider in 20 Minutes or Less&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The Praetor team is determined to continue adding value to the Akash ecosystem, and the greater Cosmos ecosystem.

This upgrade introduces enterprise-grade features like persistent storage, necessary for running all high-resource workloads. This enables developers greater flexibility for running real-world applications, like deploying validators and nodes, and expanding applications for the mining community.\\n\\n> \u201cThis is a huge milestone for Akash Network. We launched the network in March of 2021. After a year of listening to our users, gathering feedback, and optimizing for the developer, we\u2019re excited to deliver an upgrade that demonstrates the capabilities of Akash Network to support decentralized cloud infrastructure, accelerate Web3, and help users move away from centralized cloud service providers.\u201d\\n>\\n> Greg Osuri, Founder of Akash Network and CEO of Overclock Labs\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the features that are now available through the v0.16 upgrade.\\n\\n### **Persistent Storage**\\n\\nPersistent storage on Akash allows data to remain available through the lifetime of its lease. A deployment could drop, reinitialize, and move within a provider while retaining access to data stored. The provider allocates a volume on the host that is mounted within the deployment.\\n\\n> \u201cIn this release, we are enabling higher resource caps for each deployment. Deployments will now have access to 256 CPUs per service, 512 CPUs total in a deployment, 32 TB storage capacity, and 512 GB memory. Persistent storage is not just an optional feature, it is a requirement for many workload types such as large blockchain node hosting and database-backed applications.\u201d\\n>\\n> Adam Bozanich, Founder of Akash Network and CTO of Overclock Labs\\n\\nThis functionality closely mimics storage capabilities in public cloud environments. The ability for data to remain available through the life of its lease is a huge leap forward for many deployment use cases. Future releases will explore the ability to persist data across leases, adding even further capability. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/features/persistent-storage).\\n\\n### **Fractional uAKT**\\n\\nFractional uAKT removes the minimum cost of deployment. In the past, a deployment could not be cheaper than one uAKT per block. This means, extremely light workloads like a crypto wallet, or perhaps a personal blog could end up being more expensive than necessary. The limitation also would have more severe consequences as token price increases. A lightweight deployment could increase from $1 to $5 per month if the token were to double or triple in price.\\n\\nWith fractional uAKT, prices will remain consistent and resource consumption can be accurate to the cost. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/features/fractional-uakt).\\n\\n### **Authorized Spend**&nbsp;\\n\\nAuthorized Spend allows users to authorize their wallet to spend a set number of tokens by another source wallet on deployments. The authorized spend is restricted to Akash deployment activities and the recipient of the tokens would not have access to those tokens for other operations.\\n\\nThis allows large teams to work on deployments together without using shared wallets, thereby reducing security concerns. Additionally, this allows new community members to spin up deployments without access to a faucet. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/features/authorized-spend).\\n\\n### **Inflation Decay Curve**\\n\\nToday the inflation curve is handled manually by proposal voting when it is deemed necessary. On occasion, this has led to AKT scaling incorrectly with inflation going out of ideal ranges. Not only is this bad for trust in the token but it hurts token stability.\\n\\nTo solve this, the automatic curve mechanism will autocorrect when the inflation differs from the plan. This removes the need for human intervention and further stabilizes and secures the future of the token and the economics surrounding it.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1650912109-twitter-akash-mainnet3-launch2.png)\\n\\nFor more information on the Akash Network Mainnet 3 v0.16 upgrade, click [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases) and tune into Akash Weekly on Twitter Spaces, Wednesday April 27th at 9 AM PST.

Chanda is a software engineering executive and a start-up product leader who has joined Akash with 20+ years of entrepreneurial experience.\\n\\nChanda has lead engineering and product teams at early stage startups such as Strongloop, NodeSource and Gigster as well as mid to large enterprise companies including Adobe and IBM. She has a strong focus on understanding emerging trends and paradigms, and is interested in exploring and applying new technologies that enable real-world use cases. Chanda is especially proficient in working with open source governance in the Node.js ecosystem and has actively participated in M&amp;A and technical diligence process.&nbsp;\\n\\nAs if her experience isn\u2019t already impressive enough, Chanda holds a PhD in Computer science from Penn State University and a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Mathematics &amp; Statistics.&nbsp;\\n\\nAt Akash, Chanda will work at the intersection of product and engineering. Working with both the engineering team and product teams to understand how Akash is being used in order to scale our engineering team and processes for the long-term Akash roadmap.\\n\\n\u201cIn my first 30 days, coming in here, landing in the middle of a testnet kickoff, and understanding the entire process from testnet to mainnet. It's been interesting to see the dependencies and challenges, specially when unlocking new features in an open governed blockchain system.\u201d - VP of Engineering at Akash Network, Chanda Dharap\\n\\nChanda has always been interested in new technologies and believes blockchain and crypto isn\u2019t just about DeFi. When asked why she joined Akash, she explains, \u201cthere are very powerful use cases that blockchain and cryptocurrencies can enable and I was excited about the open-source, open-governance cloud use cases that Akash is already enabling only one year post-product launch. The possibilities from here are endless.\u201d&nbsp;\\n\\nAs an avid Tai Chi practitioner, water colorist, and urban chicken farmer, Chanda is full of fun surprises and likes to balance the yin and the yang and bring balance between what she does at work and what she does in her free time.&nbsp;\\n\\nThis **Wednesday, March 30th at 10 AM PST** we will be hosting our weekly **Community Call on Twitter Spaces featuring Chanda**.

This incentivized testnet allowed the Akash community to rigorously test critical features by allowing real users to perform tasks to stress test the system beyond typical usage.&nbsp;\\n\\nOver the last two weeks, we presented 38+ challenges from programmatic enforcement of inflation to letting other wallets deploy with your tokens. We took the developer further down the journey through enterprise-grade features, such as [persistent storage, fractional uAKT, authorized spend, and inflation decay curve](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRgCVoVMln9qa0F5B10wykSlC4KOtXlhM); bringing the Akash Network closer to the features offered by Big cloud providers.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn addition to the technical and qualitative challenges, there were bonus challenges involving creative content on YouTube and Medium that increased the participant's likelihood to win from a prize pot of $200,000.&nbsp;\\n\\nThese challenges covered a wide range of improvements to the functionality and durability of Akash Network and allowed developers to stress-test recently released features as we look ahead to Mainnet 3, estimated for the end of April.&nbsp;\\n\\n### **The Results**\\n\\nThe goal was to yield real-world use cases, like deploying validators and nodes, running high-resource workloads, and expanding applications for the mining community.\\n\\nWith persistent storage unlocked, Akash for Node Infrastructure was validated. We saw 135 Avalanche and 117 Terra Nodes launch on the Akash Testnet within 2 days of announcing their respective challenges.&nbsp;\\n\\nFor the first time, we challenged users to create a Chia plot using Bladebit, save on persistent storage, submit working on SDL, and then terminate Deployment. We hosted a Twitter Spaces with Jonmichael Hands from Chia Network on potential use cases he was excited to see and opportunities that come with Chia mining on Akash Network.

It allows users to stress-test recently released features focused on real-world applications, like deploying validators and nodes, running high-resource workloads, and expanding applications for the mining community.\\n\\nWith a prize pot of $200,000 in USD, Testnet 3 is launching on **March 7th at 10 am PST** and running through **March 20th at 11:59 pm PST.** The testnet is fully virtual, and we encourage participants from all regions of the world to join in and contribute to the future of Web 3.0.\\n\\n> \u201cTestnet 3 is very exciting as it serves as a precursor to our next big milestone of launching to Mainnet 3 where a myriad of new features and use cases will be unlocked. This testnet ultimately expands the functionality of Akash Network and demonstrates its capabilities to further support decentralized cloud infrastructure, helping users move away from centralized cloud service providers and onto Akash Network.\u201d\\n>\\n> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network\\n\\nTestnet 3 is how we get there.\\n\\n### **Challenges**\\n\\nTestnet 3 has a total of 38+ challenges that will be announced over the 14-day competition, starting next Monday, March 7th\\n\\nFrom programmatic enforcement of inflation to letting other wallets deploy with your tokens, the challenges under the week one umbrella cover a wide range of improvements to the functionality and durability of Akash Network.\\n\\n> \u201cIn this release, we are enabling higher resource caps for each deployment. Deployments will now have access to 256 CPUs per service, 512 CPUs total in a deployment, 32 TB storage capacity, and 512 GB memory,\u201d said Adam Bozanich, CTO of Akash Network. \u201cPersistent storage is not just an optional feature, it is a requirement for many workload types such as large blockchain node hosting and database-backed applications.\u201d\\n>\\n> Adam Bozanich, CTO of Akash Network\\n\\nThis enables developers greater flexibility for running a wide range of workloads requiring high resources. Most of these workloads have previously been unable to run on the network, like larger validators for example.\\n\\nWeek two is where we take the developer further down the journey through enterprise-grade features, bringing the Akash Network closer to the features offered by Big Tech cloud providers. In addition to the technical and qualitative challenges, there will be bonus challenges involving creative content on YouTube and Medium that will increase your likelihood to win some AKT.\\n\\n[Stay tuned and make sure you\u2019re signed up for updates](https://akash.network/testnet) as each challenge will be announced closer to their start dates to keep the playing field level.\\n\\n### **Features**&nbsp;\\n\\nSo, let\u2019s talk about the features you can play with.\\n\\n#### **Persistent Storage**\\n\\nPersistent storage on Akash allows data to remain available through the lifetime of its lease. A deployment could drop, reinitialize, and move within a provider while retaining access to data stored. The provider allocates a volume on the host that is mounted within the deployment.\\n\\nThis functionality closely mimics storage capabilities in public cloud environments. The ability for data to remain available through the life of its lease is a huge leap forward for many deployment use cases. Future releases will explore the ability to persist data across leases, adding even further capability. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/testnet-technical-docs/persistent-storage).\\n\\n#### **Fractional uAKT**\\n\\nFractional uAKT removes the minimum cost of deployment. In the past, a deployment could not be cheaper than one uAKT per block. This means, extremely light workloads like a crypto wallet, or perhaps a personal blog could end up being more expensive than necessary. The limitation also would have more severe consequences as token price increases. A lightweight deployment could increase from $1 to $5 per month if the token were to double or triple in price.\\n\\nWith fractional uAKT, prices will remain consistent and resource consumption can be accurate to the cost. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/testnet-technical-docs/fractional-uakt).\\n\\n#### **Authorized Spend**&nbsp;\\n\\nAuthorized Spend allows users to authorize their wallet to spend a set number of tokens by another source wallet on deployments. The authorized spend is restricted to Akash deployment activities and the recipient of the tokens would not have access to those tokens for other operations.\\n\\nThis allows large teams to work on deployments together without using shared wallets, thereby reducing security concerns. Additionally, this allows new community members to spin up deployments without access to a faucet. Check out the documentation, [here](https://akash.network/docs/testnet-technical-docs/authorized-spend).\\n\\n#### **Inflation Decay Curve**\\n\\nToday the inflation curve is handled manually by proposal voting when it is deemed necessary. On occasion, this has led to AKT scaling incorrectly with inflation going out of ideal ranges. Not only is this bad for trust in the token but it hurts token stability.\\n\\nTo solve this, the automatic curve mechanism will autocorrect when the inflation differs from the plan. This removes the need for human intervention and further stabilizes and secures the future of the token and the economics surrounding it.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1646060298-unnamed.jpeg)\\n\\nThis **Tuesday, March 1st** we will be hosting an AMA via Twitter Spaces at **noon PST** with our CEO Greg Osuri and CTO, Adam Bozanich, hosted by our Head of Community, Adam Wozney.

The \u201ccloud\u201d is an IT and computer science term to describe the amalgamation of global servers which can be leased out to end-users, developers, and organizations. An easy to understand analogy is to imagine how your own computer works. When you access an app, that app acts as an interpreter between you and the computer. The computer understands binary code, or 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, but you as a layman don\u2019t know how to talk to the computer in binary, so the app converts your inputs and turns them into machine-understable code. When you access the internet through a web browser, what\u2019s really happening is your computer is requesting another machine, called a server, to show you some information, which is a web page!\\n\\nThe servers which display these web pages can be run by the owner of the website, or they can be rented from third party organizations, such as Google Cloud (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS). Companies are flocking to the cloud as it is a classic case of economic specialization. Specialization is where organizations focus on a limited service which they can become experts in, create economies of scale, and deliver high-quality products cheaply. Instead of every company having to buy a bunch of machines to act as servers, creating security procedures, and managing this architecture, they can outsource all of this to Amazon and focus on their core product. The benefit becomes more apparent when you consider that a huge percentage of companies are not technology companies and don\u2019t have expertise in IT. In other words, it makes more sense for data center specialists to run a data center than for a paint company to!\\n\\nHowever, just as with self-hosted applications and websites, cloud based services can go down and crash your application. Most cloud deployment products offer redundancy services, or deploying your application on multiple servers in case one crashes, but if an entire network or organization is targeted, your application still might go down. For this reason, it makes sense to deploy your website or application on multiple cloud platforms, which is referred to as the \u201cmulti-cloud.\u201d Utilizing the multi-cloud protects you against downtime and keeps your users happy!\\n\\nAnother issue with cloud services is that they can censor your content or make deals with political rivals. For example, AWS removed all negative reviews of [Chinese Communist Dictator Xi Jinping\u2019s book](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/amazon-partnered-with-china-propaganda-arm-win-beijings-favor-document-shows-2021-12-17/). If Amazon is willing to censor you to protect a dictator, they probably won\u2019t bat an eye to censor you at the slightest inconvenience. This is another reason why you would want to utilize the multi-cloud, to protect yourself from censorship. There are countless examples of deplatforming apps, but one prominent case was the deplatforming of the social media platform, Parler. In this case, Parler was [deplatformed by Apple, Amazon, and Google](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/tech/parler-suspended-apple-app-store/index.html)! So much for the multi-cloud!\\n\\nHere lies a key issue in the twenty-first century with the multi-cloud: how can you reap the benefits of redundancy, uptime, and efficiency without the fear of censorship? This is where the benefits of blockchain technology and decentralized cloud solutions, like Akash Network, come into play. Blockchains themselves have inherent censorship resistant qualities. So long as you can find someone willing to sell you a cryptoasset, no one can stop you from owning it, unless they shut down the internet itself. The infrastructure running the blockchain protocol is also designed to be decentralized; with Akash, there are 100 different validators who produce blocks. This means that no one entity can shut down the chain and multiple actors would need to coordinate to take action on something.\\n\\nAkash Network works by allowing _anyone_ to offer their machines as servers on a network. This allows you to use regular people as your data centers instead of just big tech companies! Big tech companies could also provide their services on Akash, as Equinix does, because Akash is permissionless and can\u2019t restrict anyone from joining. However, you as the user get to decide to use big tech companies or individual providers. Providers maintain their individual sovereignty as well, they can host or not host whatever they like. As long as just one person is willing to host your deployment though, it will be deployed.\\n\\nBesides censorship protection, this format also allows you to deploy your apps anonymously. Instead of making a bunch of accounts tied to your name, you own an Akash wallet with a cryptographic address protecting your identity. This means if your deployment is hacked, your identity will be much better protected.\\n\\nAn amazing feature of Akash is that it enables access to the multi-cloud all on one platform. Whereas conventional cloud platforms require you to use a different company to use the multi-cloud, you can deploy on entirely different and unrelated providers on Akashnet. You can use Equinix, your neighbor, and random servers in Europe and Asia, all anonymously and conveniently from your desktop on the same account.&nbsp;\\n\\nAs with anything there are generic negatives to the multi-cloud. We\u2019ve touched on the coordination issues between using different companies, and some centralized providers want to keep you entirely on their native platform. It is also more work to manage your deployments on different accounts than it is on one account. Akash makes significant strides in some of these areas, but also has its drawbacks. For one, even though you can deploy your application on different providers, there\u2019s currently no managed service to automatically switch the active provider if one goes down. If you\u2019re paying attention to your deployments, this would only cause a few minutes of delay time, but it is still a factor to consider.\\n\\nAkash is still in its infancy, and the lack of managed services is exactly what you\u2019d expect from a network less than a year old.

Kubernetes and blockchain combine the flexibility to use any hardware effectively with the ability to provide and price it fairly and transparently, creating a new cloud marketplace that could change everything.\\n\\nBut how did we get here, and what exactly are these technologies? Let's take a look at where they came from and why they could be the next big thing for the cloud.\\n\\n### Commercializing and containerizing\\n\\nOver the last decade, cloud services have become the \\\\*de facto\\\\* solution to just about any web-enabled software that needs to scale up to thousands or millions of users. As the number and size of web apps and services increased, it stopped making sense to run your own servers when a secure, powerful alternative was offered for a very attractive price by the likes of Amazon, IBM, or Microsoft.\\n\\nAs these companies grew their operations, it became a battle not just for volume but for efficiency. Say Amazon is putting 100 new servers online every day and Microsoft only does 80 \u2014 but if Microsoft can run 50 percent more jobs on those servers, they come out ahead. And as efficiency is largely a software problem, it meant it could be solved with code.\\n\\nOne of those solutions is Kubernetes, which is a way of setting up and running what are called \\\\*containers.\\\\* Normally servers would run several \\&quot;virtual machines,\\&quot; basically minimalistic operating systems running side by side on the same hardware, so they could run several jobs at once in isolated computing environments.\\n\\nContainers take this idea one step further, subdividing the virtual space into even smaller sections that don't require their own OS to be running. They provide nearly all the benefits of having VMs, but without the drawback of thousands of instances of Linux or Windows eating up resources.\\n\\nKubernetes is the Greek word for \\&quot;Helmsman,\\&quot; since it's sort of like the head of the ship, directing which resources go where, when to add new containers and when to take them down. As an open-source project, it attracted an incredible amount of attention from developers all over the world who saw the potential of its approach.\\n\\n### So what if it's last year's model?\\n\\nOne of the things that's attractive about Kubernetes is that it can be used on many different kinds of servers and hardware. Old or new, top-shelf or bargain bin, Kubernetes can assess its capabilities and use it to the best of its ability.\\n\\nOf course, this is useful for lots of reasons, but a big one is that it lowers the bar for entry into the cloud services market. Here's why.\\n\\nAs cloud providers like those mentioned above became the obvious solution, they began to dominate a landscape that was once filled with dozens of smaller, regional or specialized players. This centralization has gotten to the point where the cloud services market is almost totally split between a handful of big providers.\\n\\nAs so often happens in the software and online world, the market rushed towards oligopoly as those with big leads offered services and prices that simply can't be matched by those they'd left behind.\\n\\nKubernetes may be an opportunity to change that. Small providers with a miscellany of aging hardware can activate it and offer a modern cloud hosting service that acts very much like that of the competition but at an even lower price commensurate with the lower cost of the hardware.\\n\\nThe question is, how can this be made into a true marketplace and not just a hundred small providers fighting over the scraps of the big providers? That's where blockchain comes in.\\n\\n### Open marketplace\\n\\nThe term blockchain encompasses a huge variety of new and evolving technologies, but they all share the same DNA: a shared, immutable online ledger that allows data to be stored and exchanged securely and publicly.\\n\\nIn the case of something like Bitcoin, that means that users can send and receive the digital currency, and that exchange is witnessed and recorded by everyone else who uses it. But what about the cloud services market?\\n\\nWhat's needed in order to get those small providers up to the level of Microsoft and IBM is a single shared platform where they can offer their capabilities to customers. But that platform needs to be open and transparent to prevent manipulation, automated to the extent that it can respond to shifts in demand and pricing, but reliable enough that both providers and customers can buy and sell with confidence.\\n\\nBlockchain technology offers all these things by making sure that each company on the platform lists its available capacity and the associated fees and other measures on a shared public ledger visible to other stakeholders.\\n\\n### Token economics\\n\\nOne way to set it up, as Akash has done for its marketplace along these lines, is to have a \\&quot;token,\\&quot; like Bitcoin but with no monetary value, that represents the services a company offers. If they have 10 teraflops of computing power and a gigabit connection, that is represented by a certain number and type of tokens.\\n\\nThese are tracked by the platform so that it knows exactly how much capacity is available at any time and where. A reverse auction process where providers bid what they're willing to set their price at for a certain customer sets the price \u2014 and there's no take-backs or race to the bottom since it's all on the record, available for everyone to see on the ledger.\\n\\nIn this way, a platform with a hundred small providers may actually be able to compete with the cloud superpowers, by combining their resources into a bloc that provides just as good a service (thanks to Kubernetes) with reliable and transparent pricing (thanks to blockchain) that may be well below what the others offer.\\n\\nThe internet was built as a decentralized system, but markets tend towards centralization because that's where the profits are. When it's gone too far, however, decentralizing tech reasserts itself, as is the case here. The world is rich in scattered resources and people looking for a way to make use of them \u2014 Kubernetes and blockchain could make that happen in a big way and build the next generation of the cloud.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Architecture Series Part III: Innovating Kubernetes&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In today's increasingly centralized cloud computing market, there are two rising forces for decentralization.

With a shared vision for decentralizing storage on Web3, Akash is pleased to announce a partnership with the [Chia](https://chia.net) (XCH) team. Co-founded by Bram Cohen, the author of the Bittorrent protocol, Chia blockchain is based on a new Nakamoto consensus called \\&quot;proof of space and time\\&quot; which launched in March of 2021.\\n\\nThe Chia Network depends on users around the world to contribute disk space to the network.&nbsp; So far, the network has reached over 40 exabytes in size with hundreds of thousands of farmers, creating one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies. When a Chia user's disk space is used to validate the blockchain, the user is rewarded the block reward, so users are incentivized to increase the amount of storage on the network - increasing the likelihood of mining the next block.&nbsp; Akash recently added support for Chia software, unlocking new opportunities for new and advanced users to take advantage of the dWeb.\\n\\n> \u201cWe believe that supporting plot creation on our network is an important part of Web 3.0. Plotting on Akash not only makes the process more seamless but empowers farming communities' through self-sovereignty and will allow anyone with underutilized and spare storage to earn rewards on the Chia Network.\u201d\\n>\\n> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network\\n\\n### **Plotting on Akash**\\n\\nChia proof of space are stored in a plot file, which the most common version is around 100GB. Chia farming is about getting as many of these plot files as you can on storage media, like hard disk drives. Creating these plot files requires a one-time use of computing resources and some DRAM and ephemeral storage. Most Chia farmers don't want to over-invest in these compute resources since they are only needed upfront when setting up a Chia farm (which we call \\&quot;plotting\\&quot;) for a few weeks to months. After the plot files are on the hard drive, a farmer can use those for many years.\\n\\nChia currently has 3 different plotting softwares, which require anywhere from 256gb of disk space up to 512gb of RAM.&nbsp; Plots can take anywhere from 15 min to hours depending on the hardware used.&nbsp; Needless to say, most users don\u2019t have hardware to support plotting, and turn to \u201cpay-for-plot\u201d services.&nbsp; Akash can provide these advanced hardware requirements on demand.\\n\\nAkash is the world's first dWeb platform to support [plot creation](https://www.chia.net/2021/02/22/plotting-basics.html) on its network.&nbsp; Chia users can now create NFT plots on demand in just a few clicks.&nbsp; Once the plot is created it is uploaded directly to persistent storage for farming.&nbsp; To support this complex workload, Akash created an attribute \\\\`chia-plotting = true\\\\` which makes it easy to identify providers who can create plots in under 1 hour.&nbsp; We welcome both new and advanced users to go through our [step by step guide to plotting on Akash.](https://akash.network/docs/deploy/chia-on-akash)&nbsp; Additionally, plotting services businesses can increase their plotting capacity by using Akash.\\n\\n> \u201cChia is very excited about the new Akash platform for plotting as a service. Not only is it web3 based and decentralized, but it will benefit our current farmer community by giving them the ability to monetize their idle plotting hardware that they invested in, and usher in a new generation of smaller farmers with an easy and inexpensive way to get into Chia farming.\u201d\\n>\\n> Jonmichael Hands, VP Storage, Chia Network\\n\\nChia has been searching for an easy way to support plotting as a service that can be inexpensive and get around network egress limitations from top cloud providers. As we scale from hundreds of thousands of farmers to millions of farmers, making Chia farming more inclusive for people that don't have access to compute will enable a whole new class of farmers.\\n\\n### **Farming on Akash**\\n\\nOnce a user has either generated plots or had someone else generate them, they will then begin the process of transferring them to persistent storage for farming. Farming is the stage where the plot remains on persistent storage and accessible to the internet.&nbsp; Farming does not require the same hardware as plotting.&nbsp; Users will generate plots to fill up all their persistent storage, usually multiple terabytes in size or even petabytes.&nbsp; Akash will support persistent storage and consequently farming Chia in Q1 of 2022.&nbsp; We look forward to working with the Chia team to solve any issues along the way.\\n\\n### **Repurpose Plotting Hardware**\\n\\nMany Chia users have invested thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in hardware for plot generation.&nbsp; Once they have filled their persistent storage with plots, they no longer need this high-end hardware.&nbsp; Akash gives these users the ability to breathe new life into their old plotting hardware by allowing them to become providers on the network and run plotting workloads.&nbsp; If you are interested in becoming a provider to support Chia plotting workloads please start with our [provider guide](https://akash.network/docs/operations).\\n\\nAkash is currently planning a Webinar series with the Chia team to focus on making it as easy as possible to create plots, run nodes, and use persistent storage.&nbsp; We are excited to work with our new partner to educate the world about the future of Web3.\\n\\n### **Replay of the Akash x Chia Livestream**\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How to Create NFT Plots on Akash with Chia Network&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Hello Akashian\u2019s, I'm Andrew Mello, the new Head of Mining Partnerships at Akash where I support mining communities' migration to the dWeb.

Your TV got its channels from another cable or perhaps a satellite, and your radio snatched AM or FM signals out of the air. Not anymore \u2014 all those things are digital now, and all of them use the internet to download or exchange the data they need \u2014 a show from a streaming service, a video call with friends, a new episode of your favorite podcast.\\n\\nTo make this all possible we had to build a whole new kind of 21st-century infrastructure: data centers. And they may themselves be on the verge of a revolution \u2014 here's why.\\n\\n### All data, all the time\\n\\nTo understand what data centers are, first think about why they're needed. When you take a video on your phone, it's there on your phone. And when you work on a Word document on your laptop, it's there on your laptop. But when you click \\&quot;next episode\\&quot; on your binge-watch of choice, that data isn't sitting on your hard drive \u2014 Netflix's library of shows is far too big to live on any single computer. So how do they make it available to everyone?\\n\\nThis problem actually goes back to the very origin of computers, when the hardware was the size of a room, and couldn't be moved for more convenient access. The solution then was the same as it is now: plug in a nice, long cable so you can operate the computer remotely. The difference now is a matter of scale: instead of five people who need access to the data in the basement, it's five million people who need access to data all over the world.\\n\\nWhen the internet started gaining steam, companies going online invested in servers, which are just computers that specialize in storing, processing, and communicating data. At first, these were run by the companies themselves, sometimes out of the very offices they worked in. The \\&quot;server room\\&quot; would have a few big stacks of compact computers that held all the data that made up their online services.\\n\\nBut as data-heavy digital services like YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon became commonplace, it became clear that you couldn't operate a global online company out of a hot room in an office building downtown. Not only were the demands for data and processing power increasing exponentially to the point where there wasn't enough space, but what if there was a power outage or a fire? The whole company might be taken down by a strong gust of wind.\\n\\nThe solution was to move the servers to a new dedicated location \u2014 one with plenty of space, cheap and reliable power, and a full-time staff to watch over it. Thus was the modern data center born.\\n\\n### Cultivating a server farm\\n\\nInside a data center are rows and rows of servers stacked 10 or 20 high in tall racks. Each server is about the size of a laptop, usually equipped with the latest processors and lots of RAM and storage space. But no monitor, keyboard, or mouse \u2014 instead, they are accessed remotely through miles of cables that run through the whole place, connecting each server to others and to central administration machines. Each server is an independent unit, but they can be combined together by networking to act as one larger machine. Interestingly, this means that two competing companies might pay for space in the same data center, with confidential data from one resting just inches from that of the other.\\n\\nA modern data center might have tens of thousands of servers running simultaneously on acres of space, and a single person can monitor hundreds or thousands each, zooming around on a golf cart to swap out a faulty drive or check the wiring. They run 24/7 and require constant tending and maintenance.\\n\\nYou might think that 50,000 computers in one place would be more than enough power to run something like Google, but it's not even close. What these data centers are doing is nothing less than running the entire \\&quot;cloud\\&quot; we all hear so much about. Every photo uploaded to Instagram, every file backed up on Dropbox, every presentation being collaborated on at work \u2014 they all live in a data center somewhere, often copied multiple times for easier access and backup purposes. And that's without reckoning for the millions of websites running on Amazon's AWS service, or the enormous collection of videos Netflix or Disney+ has available.\\n\\n50,000 is a good start \u2014 for one service, from one company, in one country. In fact, there are estimated to be some 3 million data centers worldwide now, most smaller but many bigger than that. Cloud-hosted services are growing faster than ever in entertainment, enterprise applications, communication, and increasingly in AI and cryptocurrency. The volume of data being uploaded and processed every day almost beggars belief, predicted to approach 100 zettabytes \u2014 that's a hundred trillion gigabytes, enough that if you put it on Blu-Ray discs you could stack it to the moon... a dozen times. And the infrastructure being built is of a scale that's difficult to visualize. What does a million square feet of servers even look like? We'll find out when data centers that size are built this year.\\n\\nBut despite all this investment, all is not well in the world of data centers and cloud services. There are a few major challenges facing the industry.\\n\\n### Asymmetry and inefficiency\\n\\nFirst is that these server farms use up a truly enormous amount of electricity. In fact, it's estimated that data centers now account for some two percent of all power usage worldwide. Interestingly, only a fraction of this power goes to the servers themselves \u2014 most of it is used to keep the facilities cool, since tens of thousands of computers working hard day and night produce a lot of heat. For this reason not only are data centers increasingly located in places with cheap renewable power but also where the air is naturally cold, lowering the A/C bill. New approaches to software and administration are affecting this too but with thousands of servers coming online every week, it's hard to say whether it will be enough.\\n\\nThe second and more fundamental issue is that all this power is not being efficiently used. Even though servers are efficient individually and data centers are the best way to provide billions of people with trillions of bytes of data, it turns out most of these facilities are rarely using more than a fraction of their capacity.\\n\\nTo understand why that is, think about what these data centers are doing. One located in, say, Michigan will be providing services primarily to people in that region \u2014 since it's faster and cheaper to access data that's nearby \u2014 but also mainly people in that time zone. The servers are going to be loaded with English-language content from U.S.-based services and companies.\\n\\nDuring the day and into the evening, when everyone is taking meetings, streaming shows, and playing games, that data center may be using half its total capacity. And if there's a big surge, like a new episode of a popular show or a live event on YouTube, maybe it's higher. But what happens when everyone in Detroit, Atlanta, and for that matter Havana and Lima go to bed? That Michigan data center goes quiet too, only a few percent of its resources active \u2014 but the whole facility idling, consuming power, and producing heat. By some estimates, only 15 percent of data centers' capabilities are actually being used.\\n\\n### Distributing and decentralizing data centers\\n\\nSeems like a waste, doesn't it? All around the world data centers are being built, only to sit inactive 85 percent of the time. What can be done to improve this?\\n\\nThe best single way to improve efficiency is to find out what servers are not being used and when, and put them to work instead of spinning up a new one. For every data center that's being underutilized, on the other side of the planet, there is likely one that's full up.\\n\\nFor instance, if you're an AI company based in Mumbai, you _could_ pay to train up your machine learning model on a local data center, but you'd be paying for time when those resources are most in-demand in the area. Just like with any other commodity, that means the price is high for what you get. So why not make a deal with the folks in Michigan, whose data center is currently idling at 5-10 percent usage?\\n\\nOf course, it's not as convenient to have to transfer all that data over thousands of miles of cables, and there are other compromises, but if there's no rush on getting the data where it needs to be \u2014 unlike those for video calls, these packets can wait a few seconds \u2014 this is a good solution for both parties. The Indian AI company gets cheap data center access, and the Michigan provider gets paid during slack hours.\\n\\nThe question is, how do we do this globally and reliably? What's emerged is something called a reverse auction system, another concept that actually goes back many decades. In it, multiple companies pitch similar services \u2014 in this case, handling a customer's online data \u2014 and compete with each other for a single customer, who chooses between their bids. It's simple enough that a company can just set the price they're willing to pay and see if the market will accommodate them.\\n\\n### Innovation makes it possible\\n\\nDoing this equitably and predictably is important, though, as any market is open to manipulation. Akash provides a system for oversight and provision of marketplaces for spare data center capacity. By joining together several providers and stakeholders with access to a large amount of the asset in question \u2014 servers, basically \u2014 they can form a sort of self-monitoring consortium that agrees to sell those assets under a set of reasonable rules while still allowing for competition on price.\\n\\nThis only works if you can be sure of two things: that there's enough supply, and that everyone involved is being honest. In the first place, Akash has partnered with Equinix, one of the largest providers of cloud services in the world at the \\&quot;bare metal\\&quot; level, meaning maximum configurability and flexibility. Having huge suppliers like this means the marketplace is large enough for big customers to take part.\\n\\nAs for the question of honesty, the primary innovation of blockchain technology is removing the possibility of dishonesty from the table. A special cryptocurrency token is used to record the supply and deals undertaken on the network, all on an immutable community ledger accessible to all stakeholders.\\n\\nWith these taken care of, companies around the world can be sure that they always have the option of securely and fairly purchasing data center resources from major providers at rock-bottom prices they can effectively set themselves. As this model gains steam the utilization levels of existing data centers will increase, bolstering their income and solving the efficiency problem at the same time.\\n\\nOf course, it doesn't mean we won't ever have to build new ones \u2014 but with chip shortages and economic woes plaguing the globe, maybe now's a good time to take a break and focus on using what we already have.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Architecture Series Part II: Data Centers&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Decades ago, your phone was at the end of a long copper wire.

With a shared vision for a decentralized web, ColdStack has announced plans to deploy on Akash in order to expand its node network capabilities and scale.\\n\\n> \u201cWe see the deployment of these nodes as just the first step in an ongoing technical collaboration with ColdStack. As the metaverse expands and NFTs (which require a great deal of reliance and variation in its storage needs) become more mainstream and widely adopted, it\u2019s important to have affordable, accessible storage that is also in line with the values of Web 3.0. We\u2019re proud to be able to offer decentralized infrastructure as a foundational element of the future of the Internet.\u201d&nbsp;\\n> \\n> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network\\n\\nNow, any individual can use Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 API methods to upload a file to the file node which allows users to move and manage data with no or minimal coding, making it easy to migrate data from Amazon to ColdStack. Users can retrieve a previously stored file via S3 REST API (by specifying UUID) or via URL (Amazon virtual buckets engine). ColdStack\u2019s file node infrastructure will allow us to eventually implement a full-scale caching service that will be able to cache files during file retrieval. Deploying these nodes to Akash makes it so you can pair the reliability of S3 with the sustainability of Akash\u2019s Network.\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n\\nThe collaboration will begin with ColdStack deploying its file nodes to the Akash Network which will play a key role in the overall infrastructure. At the time of this partnership, all testing has been completed and ColdStack has already deployed its node, which is now in operation.&nbsp;\\n\\n> \\&quot;Our team is very happy with how well the integration with Akash has gone. The node deployment process was incredibly easy, and we\u2019re already seeing a boost in our performance. We\u2019re looking forward to deploying more file nodes on Akash, and incorporating their infrastructure even further in the future.\u201d\\n> \\n> Alexander Shishow, CEO of ColdStack\\n\\nFile nodes are responsible for all interactions during the data uploading/downloading process. These nodes record the metadata regarding an individual's files and replicate it in order to eventually recall a user\u2019s metadata. Metadata contains the file size and hash (to control the file\u2019s integrity), a specific user\u2019s wallet hash, and a record of which gateway node the file node eventually interacts with. This metadata is securely stored on the blockchain and can be easily verified.\\n\\n### **Why It Matters**\\n\\nWeb 3.0 is a vision of true decentralization so that \u201cthe power\u201d sits not in the hands of larger corporations, or what some refer to as the Big 5, but with the majority. Web 3.0 prioritizes ownership over your own digital identity, a term we like to refer to as self-sovereignty.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo get to the next generation of the Internet, the web needs to truly be decentralized and that starts with layer 1; decentralizing your cloud infrastructure. Rather than hosting its nodes with a centralized entity, ColdStack combines the immutability provided by decentralization with the reliability of a traditional hosting service through Akash Network. This ultimately improves the overall decentralization of its network, making decentralized storage more affordable and easy to access.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo learn more about node network capabilities on Akash tune in via Twitter Spaces to hear from our Director of DevRels, Eric Zietlow, and Justin Silver, Head of Communications at Coldstack Thursday, January 6th from 2 - 3 pm PST. **Click** [**here to save your spot**](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1vAxRkmLZAvKl)**!**&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;ColdStack Partners with Akash to Expand Node Network Capabilities&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As Akash Network continues to scale and onboard new users contributing to Web 3.0, it\u2019s important to have different storage options as the leading decentralized cloud infrastructure provider.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;],[0,&quot;Partners&quot;],[0,&quot;Product&quot;],[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Kelsey Ruiz&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.SfG-lAsJ.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;height&quot;:[0,675],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/coldstack-partners-with-akash-to-expand-node-network-capabilities/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;2021-recap-the-road-to-gpu-support/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;2021-recap-the-road-to-gpu-support&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAs the year comes to a close, personally and professionally, we tend to get introspective; analyzing our year, celebrating our milestones, and looking ahead to new goals for the New Year.\\n\\nThis year, not only did we launch Akash Network, a distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute and the first alternative to Big Tech computing solutions, but we stabilized and optimized the network, ensuring it was ready to scale and finding product-market fit along the way.\\n\\nIn [Messari\u2019s Crypto Theses for 2022](https://messari.io/crypto-theses-for-2022?s=01), they note that \u201cwithin the Cosmos ecosystem, application-specific blockchains like Akash continue to expand and produce early signs of sustainable network revenue as they match developers who deploy their Docker containers at a significantly reduced cost to cloud providers like AWS or Google, and data centers who can rent excess capacity similar to an Airbnb for data.\u201d While this is exciting for Akash and its users, it\u2019s encouraging for the trailblazers of Web 3.0 as a whole, which is much closer to fruition than many of us thought possible.\\n\\nWe saw a 400x increase in deployments throughout the year and hit the 100 mark in just 112 days after the launch of Akash Network. From there, we saw daily active deployments more than triple.\\n\\n- Q2: 100 average daily active deployments\\n- Q3: 312 average daily active deployments\\n- Q4: 448 average daily active deployments\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1640652145-screen-shot-2021-12-27-at-4-42-20-pm.png)\\n\\nWith a total of 60,000 deployments, 9 partnerships, 7 new listings, and a handful of new product features (like storage) in our first year, 2021 was a big one for Akash Network and there\u2019s a lot to look back on, but even more to look forward to.\\n\\n### **The TL;DR**\\n\\n- March 2021 Akash Network launched its open-source, decentralized cloud, the first alternative to Big Tech centralized cloud service providers.\\n- We saw a 400x increase in deployments throughout the year and hit the 100 mark in just 112 days after launch.\\n- Since releasing our 2022 Product Roadmap in September, the Core Dev team has made [remarkable progress](https://akash.network/blog/q2-2022-update-for-akash-roadmap) and cleared the pathway for a GPU Marketplace on Akash in early 2022.\\n- Akash Token (AKT) is now on a total of 8 exchanges. This year we announced listings on BHEX, [Bittrex Global](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-networks-akash-token-akt-is-listed-on-bittrex-global-301298348.html), Gate.io as well as decentralized exchanges such as Osmosis and Emeris.\\n- This year, we established 9 key partnerships with foundational partners and mining communities such as Equinix Metal, Helium, Kava, Polygon, pkt.cash, and Skynet Labs.\\n- We had a 271% increase in our community this year and now have 85,266 total community members around the world.\\n- We\u2019re in the home stretch of unlocking GPU support and just have one more step along the way in the form of a Testnet, coming Q1 2022.\\n\\n### **Product**&nbsp;\\n\\nFive years in the works, 2021 was the year Akash Network launched its open-source, decentralized cloud, the first alternative to Big Tech centralized cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. With the launch of Akash Network, developers are able to launch applications such as DeFi apps, blogs, games, data visualizations, block explorers, blockchain nodes, and other blockchain network components on a decentralized cloud.\\n\\nAs a developer-centric platform, this past year was focused on user feedback, enhancing functionality, and overall simplifying the user experience. Through the development of the IBC Relayer, a vehicle for blockchains to communicate, easy-to-use [deploy tools](https://akashlytics.com/deploy), and [Akash Omnibus](https://github.com/ovrclk/cosmos-omnibus) that allows developers to spin up other Cosmos blockchain nodes with just a few clicks (pssst, run don\u2019t walk, we\u2019ve just doubled the number of blockchains that it supports), we\u2019ve not only seen the number of active deployments more than triple, but we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in AKT spend.\\n\\nSince releasing our [2022 Product Roadmap](https://akash.network/roadmap) in September, our Core Dev team has made a lot of progress on the ASN Market which allows dedicated IP addresses (and ports) for workloads and marketplace to source them. This unlocks new use cases where workloads require standard ports and a dedicated IP address.\\n\\nIn addition to the ASN Market, we\u2019ve added some features on our blockchain like storage and tooling, ultimately clearing the pathway for a GPU Marketplace on Akash in early 2022.\\n\\n### **Listings**&nbsp;\\n\\nAKT is now on a total of 8 exchanges. This year we announced listings on BHEX and [Bittrex Global](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-networks-akash-token-akt-is-listed-on-bittrex-global-301298348.html) and are seeing an influx of decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear on the market that allows for fewer regulatory restrictions, lower transactions fees, and higher incentives.\\n\\n#### **Decentralized Exchanges**\\n\\nOur first DEX listing was Osmosis, an automated market maker (AMM) protocol built for liquidity providers, allowing users to earn rewards for providing liquidity. Users are now able to pair the Cosmos native coin, atom (ATOM), one of the most widely available tokens in the world, to AKT, significantly increasing access to our utility token. This enables ATOM holders with the ability to swap their ATOM for AKT, increasing the incentives to buy and hold AKT by incentivizing liquidity pools with OSMO tokens for offering their AKT to the pool.\\n\\nHosted on Akash, Osmosis was a huge success with over $100-million in Total Locked Value in its first month.\\n\\n> \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Akash Network be one of the first launch partners of Osmosis. Akash Network enables a new generation of resilient, decentralized Internet infrastructure to be built, and Osmosis provides a gateway for anyone to take part in this decentralized economy. For Osmosis to be a truly decentralized exchange, we need to be built on a decentralized infrastructure. Osmosis will be a proud user of Akash infrastructure to host our applications and API-serving nodes.\u201d\\n>\\n> Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis\\n\\n[AKT is now supported on a second decentralized exchange](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-announces-its-utility-token-akt-is-supported-by-a-second-decentralized-exchange-301361241.html), Emeris, a portal to cross-chain DeFi. As one of the first tokens available on Emeris, users can now swap, transfer, pool and manage AKT across multiple chains. Emeris saw four million in Total Locked Value in less than a week.\\n\\n### **Partnerships &amp; Hackathons**\\n\\nThis year, we established key partnerships which laid the foundation for Akash Network and presented the building blocks that are necessary for tomorrow. These partnerships include:\\n\\n- [**Equinix Metal X Akash**](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/106781/akash-network-integrates-equinix-metal-provide-first-viable-decentralized-cloud): We kicked off the year by integrating with Equinix Metal to enable developers and companies to decentralize their cloud infrastructure. Equinix is the world's largest data center and colocation infrastructure provider, with 220 data centers in 25 countries. This was the first domino that allowed us to offer a faster, more efficient, and lower-cost decentralized cloud alternative.\\n- [**HashQuark X Akash**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-partners-with-hashquark-the-worlds-largest-staking-service-provider): Hashquark is a leading staking+ service provider that runs nodes for over 40 blockchain projects including Polkadot, Klaytn, and Cosmos. Back in April, they announced they\u2019ve joined Akash Network\u2019s validator set. Leo Li, CEO of HashQuark said, \u201cour partnership with Akash Network represents our belief and trust in their professional team and forward-looking plans. We are thrilled to work with Akash Network and become part of this awesome project, helping its network vastly expand while ensuring security, paving the way for a more enabling public blockchain ecology.\u201d\\n- [**Certik Chain X Akash**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-the-first-open-source-cloud-partners-with-certik-the-blockchain-cybersecurity-leader-301274493.html): A Blockchain and smart contract cybersecurity company followed, allowing their clients to decentralize their cloud infrastructure through using Akash while ensuring on-chain protection backed by CertiK\u2019s trusted products and services.\\n- [**Helium Network X Akash**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-provides-decentralized-cloud-to-the-largest-internet-of-things-iot-network-helium-301300571.html): This year, we were selected by the largest peer-to-peer wireless internet-of-things (IoT) network, to provide a decentralized, open-source, and low-cost cloud alternative for Helium\u2019s new blockchain validators.

Akash Network helps miners find and lease cloud-hosted CPU and bandwidth from data centers at a lower cost than traditional cloud providers. PKT miners operating on Akash spend 50% less compared to centralized cloud providers. Akash customers also reduce the risk of having operations shut down by providers. While providers ultimately decide if they want to stop bidding on a deployment, the providers on Akash Network are crypto-friendly and benefit by monetizing their underutilized hardware infrastructure on Akash\u2019s marketplace. Click [here](https://www.chandrastation.com/) to see how to deploy a PKT announcement miner on Akash Network.\\n- [**Skynet X Akash**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-and-skynet-labs-integrate-301320746.html): We integrated with Skynet Labs to bring together the compute and storage layers in order to provide the first full-stack decentralized web solution to handle backup, restore, and migration. Developers can now host their applications on a fully decentralized cloud.

At the beginning of 2020, our community totaled 22,843 members. As of the time of this blog post, we have _85,266 total community members around the world_. A 273% increase!\\n\\nOur main community hubs are in the United States, China, Russia, and Korea. However, we\u2019re not stopping there. With the help of our Insider community (we\u2019ll cover that next) we have plans to grow our local hubs in South America, Turkey, India, Portugal, and beyond.\\n\\nWe are so humbled by the growth and efforts of our community and wouldn\u2019t be in the place we are today if it were not for the dedication and passion of our global community.\\n\\n#### **Akash Insiders**\\n\\nThe Akash Insiders are community moderators, event organizers, and content contributors. They are leaders within our community and spearhead the growth of not just Akash, but the entire crypto ecosystem in cities and towns, globally.\\n\\nLast summer, when we launched the Insiders program, we didn\u2019t know if anyone inside the Akash community would be interested in joining. After all, the program is volunteer-based and many members of our community have jobs and live outside of crypto. We were blown away by the interest and response. Since its launch, we\u2019ve had over 268 applications to participate and we\u2019ve onboarded 28 Akash Insiders. Insiders are the tip of the spear and we have big plans for the program in 2022 and look forward to onboarding many more Insiders over the coming days and months. If you\u2019d like to get involved as an Akash Insider, click [here](https://akash.network/community?form=true#insiders).\\n\\n#### **Community Events**\\n\\nThe pandemic has affected everyone and Akash has not been immune to the effects of this global pandemic. However, with restrictions calming and precautions in place, we\u2019ve been able to increase our reach through local in-person gatherings and online activities.\\n\\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve held 82 online events. From Youtube Livestreams to Telegram AMA\u2019s to Twitter Spaces events. We\u2019ve been able to connect with our community. In addition to online events, We hosted our first-ever in-person Akash meetups in New York, during Messari Mainnet.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1640653069-pxl20210921223914533-mp.jpg)\\n\\nWe also hosted a series of events in Lisbon during Solana Breakpoint. We could have never done any of these events without the help of numerous partners such as Ledger, Infura, Polygon, Filebase, Agoric, Osmosis, and of course, Cosmos.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1640653114-pxl20211109183443371-night.jpg)\\n\\n### **2022**&nbsp;\\n\\nAs the world becomes more digitalized, we see GPUs everywhere. Not just in computers but cell phones, gaming consoles, and yes, even Teslas. And, as Ethereum moves towards a PoS model, it\u2019s inevitable that more will hit the market at that time.\\n\\nOnce unlocked, GPU support on Akash will not only open the door for the next generation of Web3 games but will unlock unprecedented Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. Meaning, everyone will be able to run _even more_ complex workloads without fear of de-platforming or censorship.\\n\\n> \u201cThis has been a monumental year with the launch of Akash Network, a product for developers by developers that Adam Bozanich, my Cofounder, and I created as a result of dealing with the barriers that centralized cloud providers presented. We saw a need and wanted a better alternative for the builders of tomorrow. We\u2019re that much closer towards a flourishing Web 3.0 and with GPU support on the docket, we\u2019re excited to crack open a whole new array of use cases.\u201d\\n>\\n> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network\\n\\nWe\u2019re in the home stretch and just have one more step along the way in the form of a Testnet. Coming early 2022, we\u2019ll share more details on what the challenges look like and how you can participate in unlocking the future of Web 3.0.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;2021 Recap: The Road to GPU Support&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As the year comes to a close, personally and professionally, we tend to get introspective; analyzing our year, celebrating our milestones, and looking ahead to new goals for the New Year.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;],[0,&quot;Developers&quot;],[0,&quot;Partners&quot;],[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Kelsey Ruiz&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.Dauecxe4.jpg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1124],&quot;height&quot;:[0,424],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;orientation&quot;:[0,1],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/2021-recap-the-road-to-gpu-support/banner-image.jpg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;q2-2022-update-for-akash-roadmap/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;q2-2022-update-for-akash-roadmap&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAt the beginning of this quarter, the Akash core team published an ambitious roadmap, the [Akash Roadmap 2022](https://akash.network/blog/product-roadmap-2022). Now we are at the end of our first quarter, here's is an update on how we are progressing through the roadmap.\\n\\nIn summary, WAGMI.\\n\\n### **Persistent Storage**\\n\\nAkash now supports persistence storage (the most requested feature) in the Testnet. This feature requires a chain upgrade for Mainnet, which is currently planned for Q1 2022.\\n\\nPersistence storage allows workloads to persist data between restarts, ideal for data-intensive workloads such as blockchain nodes, Solana and Ethereum.\\n\\n**Status:** Testnet\\n\\n**Since:** [0.15.0 (rc4)](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.15.0-rc4)\\n\\n**Related Pull Request(s):**\\n\\n- [feat: persistent storage #1348](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1348)\\n- [docs(storage): setup and usage of persistent storage #1471](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1348)\\n\\n### **Network Usage Dashboard**\\n\\nThe first version of the Network usage dashboard is complete and deployed in production, naturally running on Akash, and available at [stats.akash.network](https://stats.akash.network).\\n\\nThis version is inspired by [Akashlytics](https://www.akashlytics.com/); the future version will include several provider-related metrics.\\n\\nThe source code is now being cleaned up and open-sourced momentarily with an announcement planned for early next year.\\n\\n**Status:** Live ([stats.akash.network](https://stats.akash.network))\\n\\n### **Hostname Migration**\\n\\nAkash now supports Hostname Migration in the upcoming Testnet. Usage documentation is available [here](https://akash.network/docs/release-notes/v0.14.0#hostname-migration). This feature requires a chain upgrade for Mainnet, which is currently planned for Q1 2022.\\n\\nDeployment of an updated workload encounters a challenge when the DNS hostname remains active on the existing deployment.&nbsp; An example scenario is presented to ensure understanding of the challenge - followed by a review of the mechanism introduced in this release to migrate a hostname to the new deployment.\\n\\n**Status:** Testnet\\n\\n**Since:** [0.14.0](https://akash.network/docs/release-notes/v0.14.0)\\n\\n**Related Pull Request(s):**\\n\\n- [feat(provider): rework hostname management to use a kube operator #1365](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1365)\\n\\n### **TTY (Shell) Access**&nbsp;\\n\\nTTY Access is implemented in the Testnet. This feature requires a chain upgrade for Mainnet, which is currently planned for Q1 2022.\\n\\nTTY Access allows developers to access the shell of the container that the application is running in. This provides the ability to easily debug. Currently, debugging and running applications on Akash is difficult, as users can not run arbitrary commands on a running container. TTY access unblocks this and allows users to run any command.\\n\\n**Status:** Testnet\\n\\n**Since:** [0.14.0](https://akash.network/docs/release-notes/v0.14.0)\\n\\n**Related Pull Request(s):**\\n\\n- [Add provider lease-shell command #1293](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1293)\\n\\n### **Inflation Decay Curve**&nbsp;\\n\\nInflation Decay Curve is implemented in the Testnet. This feature requires a chain upgrade for Mainnet, which is currently planned for Q1 2022.\\n\\nOn-chain [inflation decay curve](https://akash.network/roadmap?feature=inflation-decay-curve) ensures inflation decay occurs every block period without needing governance proposals.\\n\\n**Status:** Testnet\\n\\n**Since:** [0.15.0 (rc4)](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.15.0-rc4)\\n\\n**Related Pull Request(s):**\\n\\n- [feat(inflation): Implement Akash custom inflation function according to the whitepaper. #1352](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1352)\\n\\n### Airdrop Faucet\\n\\nThe first version of the [Faucet](https://akash.network/roadmap?feature=airdrop-faucet) is complete and deployed in production, available at [drip.akash.network.](https://drip.akash.network) This version emits 20 Akash Token (AKT) and has a minor delay (for manual verification)&nbsp; to prevent fraud. The future versions will employ automatic algorithms that will transmit tokens in real-time.\\n\\nThe source code is now being cleaned up and open-sourced momentarily. Announcement planned for January.\\n\\n**Status:** Live ([drip.akash.network](https://drip.akash.network))\\n\\n### **Provider Onboarding Framework**&nbsp;\\n\\nCurrently, there is an enormous and intricate set of steps that a provider needs to execute in order to provide compute on the Akash Network. This leads to confusion and instability of the provider. A new provider onboarding framework will increase adoption, optimize the onboarding process, and eliminate potential issues with the provider in the future.\\n\\nA provider onboarding framework is to ease new providers selling compute on Akash, planned to be released in Q4 of 2021 is now delayed.\\n\\nThe automation for bootstrapping a node is code-complete and tested internally for Testnet and Devnets; the documentation is, however, still pending, so we\u2019re moving this deliverable to next quarter. The helm charts for installing various components are available at [ovrclk/helm-charts](https://github.com/ovrclk/helm-charts).\\n\\n**Status**: Incomplete\\n\\n**Related Repositories:**\\n\\n- [ovrclk/helm-charts](https://github.com/ovrclk/helm-charts)\\n\\n### **Developer Hub**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe developer hub will be a one-stop shop for all developer-related content such as guides, tutorials, documentation, architecture, and discussions.\\n\\n**Status:** Not Started\\n\\n**Estimate (Updated):** Q1 2022\\n\\n### **ASN (IP Addresses) Market**&nbsp;\\n\\nThis Feature Dedicated IP addresses (and ports) for workloads and the marketplace to source them.\\n\\nWorkloads hosted on Akash share IP addresses because there is no facility to assign individual IP addresses to applications. This presents limitations with routing. Hostname name-based routing has to rely on HTTP or SSL. To accommodate for TCP / UDP, Akash assigns random ports and there is no way to multiplex TCP services over a single port. This also slows down fault recovery as DNS services require record updates which are slow to propagate. An ability to assign a dedicated IP address will solve this issue.\\n\\n**Status:** Incomplete\\n\\n**Estimate (Updated):** Q1 2022\\n\\n### **Log Retention**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Log Retention feature provides the ability to retain logs between restarts\\n\\n**Status:** Incomplete\\n\\n**Estimate (Updated):** Q1 2022\\n\\n**Related Pull Request(s):**\\n\\n- [Provider JWT Service #1417](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1417)\\n\\n### **\u200b\u200bEthereum Bridge**\\n\\nThe Ethereum Bridge enables AKT users to acquire AKT using various ERC-20 tokens (USDT). By enabling users with more options to buy and sell AKT, we can increase liquidity, eliminate friction points found in the new developer onboarding process, and attract additional AKT buyers and traders from the crypto retail market. Additionally, this will increase our likelihood of working with Tier 1 exchanges and DEXs like Uniswap.\\n\\nThe [Gravity Bridge](https://www.gravitybridge.net) went live on [December 14](https://twitter.com/gravity_bridge/status/1470896532257861635). We\u2019re currently testing the bridge and the AKT ERC-20 contract is currently under development and audit.\\n\\n**Status:** Mainnet\\n\\n**Related Repositories:**\\n\\n- [Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge)\\n\\n### **Akash Javascript SDK**&nbsp;\\n\\nJavascript SDK simplifies extending Akash in Javascript applications by providing libraries to improve access to the Akash API. The SDK also abstracts standard functions like credential management, retries, data marshaling, serialization, and deserialization.\\n\\nThe first version is complete and currently being tested on a new notification service to be announced next quarter.\\n\\n**Status:** Incomplete\\n\\n**Updated Estimate:**&nbsp; Q1 2022\\n\\n### **AKCMD Deploy Tool**&nbsp;\\n\\nAKCMD is a command-line utility that simplifies workload management on the Akash network. AKCMD is a complementary tool to core Akash CLI that focuses on improving tenant workflow by taking an opinionated approach to deployment on Akash Network.\\n\\nMuch progress has been made and the first version will be ready by mid-January.\\n\\n**Status:** Incomplete\\n\\n**Updated Estimate:** Q1 2022\\n\\n### **Lease Renegotiation**&nbsp;\\n\\nThis feature provides the ability for users to renegotiate the AKT price without breaking the lease. The volatility of AKT leads to unstable value exchanges, as the AKT denominated price is set during lease creation and doesn\u2019t change until the lease terminates. When the dollar AKT is higher than it was during lease creation, it may benefit the provider at the cost of the tenant and vice versa. An ability to renegotiate the lease during its life cycle solves this issue.\\n\\nWe\u2019re exploring a new stable payment mechanism for Akash as part of Akashian Economics 2.0. This feature may be obsolete.\\n\\n**Status:** Not Started\\n\\n**Updated Estimate:** Not Planned\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Q4 Update on Akash Roadmap 2022&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;At the beginning of this quarter, the Akash core team published an ambitious roadmap, the Akash Roadmap 2022.

In this blog, together we\u2019ll explore what IBC is, how it works and why it\u2019s important, but first, why should you care?&nbsp; IBC is a core component enabling the Cosmos vision and feeding the narrative that the [Cosmos](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro) network is the \u201cInternet of blockchains.\u201d Like gravity, IBC will help pull economic value into the growing blockchain that is the Cosmos Hub.&nbsp; So without further ado, let\u2019s delve into IBC\u2019s unique properties, features and what\u2019s in store next.&nbsp; Let\u2019s get to it.\\n\\n### What is IBC?\\n\\nIBC is short for Inter-Blockchain Communication.&nbsp; It has been developed as part of the greater Cosmos network ecosystem by IBC contributors such as Tendermint, Interchain Foundation and Agoric Systems.&nbsp; In its simplest form, IBC is connecting different blockchains together.&nbsp; Up until now, blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many others operate in their own silo or as if each blockchain was its own deserted island, disconnected from the rest of the world or other blockchains and unable to communicate.&nbsp; It gets rather lonely.\\n\\nThe IBC protocol is a vehicle for blockchains to socially network (communicate, swap tokens and information).&nbsp; IBC is kind of what the TCP protocol is to the internet.&nbsp; Prior to TCP, the internet was a collection of desperate computer networks that didn\u2019t communicate well between each other.&nbsp; Together, with IP, TCP/IP standardized how data was sent and routed over computer networks.&nbsp; Today, TCP/IP seamlessly underpins how we consume and enjoy the internet every day.&nbsp; Similarly, IBC standardizes how blockchains communicate. Hence, Cosmos is often referred to as the \u201cInternet of blockchains\u201d.\\n\\n# How does IBC work?\\n\\nEach blockchain that wants to communicate with one another sends and receives header files to keep track of validator sets. Put simply, they run a light client of each other to keep track of one another's blockchain/ledger.&nbsp; When sending tokens from one blockchain to the other, tokens must first be:\\n\\n1.  Bonded (held in trust) in preparation for the transaction (i.e. 100 ATOM)\\n2.  A proof must be sent to the receiving blockchain that the tokens have been bonded\\n3.  The receiving chain must verify the proof of the 100 bonded ATOM tokens\\n4.  If the proof is verified, 100 ATOM tokens are frozen/bonded on the originating chain, while a representation of the 100 ATOM are created on the new chain\\n\\nTo be compatible with IBC, a blockchain must have fast finality.&nbsp; Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are both proof of work systems, do not have this capability.&nbsp; Each blockchain must maintain its own validator set.&nbsp; In doing so, blockchains maintain better interoperability with applications.\\n\\nScaling this solution becomes challenging if multiple blockchains want to communicate with one another.&nbsp; Connections can get out of hand quickly.&nbsp; This is where the Cosmos Hub comes into play. Hubs act as the aggregators, enabling a singular blockchain to communicate with many blockchains.&nbsp; The hub enables a network of blockchains or the \u2018internet of blockchains\u201d.\\n\\n### Why is IBC important?\\n\\nIBC is a critical element to the Cosmos framework connecting sovereign blockchains.&nbsp; This creates tremendous value to the network, beyond the obvious ability to swap tokens and information. Paired with the Tendermint BFT engine, Cosmos SDK, and other tools, developers can scale blockchains with speed, security and interoperability within or outside of the Cosmos network.&nbsp; This kind of versatility can be a powerful incentive for new or existing blockchains to build with or connect to Cosmos via the IBC protocol thereby growing the value of the Cosmos network, in addition to its capability and utility.\\n\\n### Blockchain Integrations\\n\\nIn addition to token transfers, IBC also facilitates interaction with the IBC data oracle.&nbsp; IBC compatible blockchains use this protocol to access [BandChain](https://docs.bandchain.org/whitepaper/cosmos-IBC.html)_**.**_\\n\\nBandChain indexes blockchain data from IBC connected sources.&nbsp; BandChain receives requests for information and processes the transactions accordingly. In plain English, IBC connects several blockchains together, making cross-chain queries, data and analytics possible.&nbsp; To simplify and scale access to BandChain, [StarPort](https://starport.com/) was born.&nbsp; StarPort accelerates the adoption curve of using BandChain***,*** as well as many other aspects of blockchain development.\\n\\n### Customizations\\n\\nTo be IBC compatible, a blockchain consensus layer must offer fast finality.&nbsp; Proof of Work (PoW) systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum do not offer fast finality.&nbsp; To address this problem, IBC offers \u201cpegs\u201d as an intermediary between the blockchain and the Cosmos Hub.&nbsp; The peg will translate the PoW system into one that has fast finality and is compatible with IBC.&nbsp; Ethereum in particular has its own peg or bridge that we\u2019ll talk about later.\\n\\nIBC and the broader Cosmos network support and enable the building and networking of sovereign blockchains.&nbsp; While Ethereum supports a wide range of L2 applications/DAPP\u2019s and DeFi, its services are constrained to the limitation of EVM\u2019s (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and the Ethereum protocol.&nbsp; With Cosmos and IBC DAPP\u2019s and services are sovereign to make decisions and integrate at an L1 layer to maximize efficiencies, security or scalability to the specific needs of a project.\\n\\n### Governance\\n\\nThe Cosmos network builds and maintains the IBC protocol.&nbsp; ATOM, being the native token of the Cosmos network, enables [Validators](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-a-validator) and [Delegators](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-a-delegator) the ability to stake ATOM to secure the network and in return receive voting eligibility for new proposals.&nbsp; Changes to the IBC protocol and other aspects of the Cosmos network must be approved by the community prior to implementation.&nbsp; This gives anyone the ability who\u2019s staking and/or validating the opportunity to influence the direction of the project.&nbsp; While running a Validator node does take technical skills, Delegators can easily participate and are also highly encouraged to contribute to the governance process.\\n\\n### Business Enablement\\n\\n[_**Osmosis**_](https://app.osmosis.zone/) is the first Cosmos native interchain Decentralized Exchange or DEX and Automated Money Maker or AMM for short.&nbsp; Osmosis facilitates the trade of Cosmos IBC enabled tokens such as ATOM, OSMO, AKT, LUNA, UST, etc. &nbsp; More than that, it enables AirDrops, Staking, Voting, Liquidity Pooling and Analytics.\\n\\n[**Sifchain**](https://sifchain.finance/) is an OMNI Chain Decentralized Exchange or DEX and Automated Money Maker or AMM.&nbsp; The native token to Sifchain is ROWAN.&nbsp; What makes Sifchain special is it enables token transfers among the top 20 blockchains and is IBC connected, BinanceChain, Bitcoin, EOS, Polkadot etc.&nbsp; Becoming a Liquidity Provider on Sifchain can bring juicy APY\u2019s (Annual Percentage Yield) depending on the pair!\\n\\n[**Emeris**](https://emeris.com/) is a new OMNI Chain Decentralized Exchange or DEX and Automated Money Maker or AMM, developed by the Tendermint foundation.&nbsp; Aims include multi-wallet support, access to diverse DeFi platforms, multi-chain staking, and a mobile application.&nbsp; Emeris features the all-new [Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge#:~:text=Gravity%20bridge%20is%20Cosmos,chain%20and%20back%20to%20Ethereum.), which is a great segway to our next topic, the Ethereum network.\\n\\n### Gravity Bridge and Cross Ecosystem Transfer of Value\\n\\nThe [Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/cosmos/gravity-bridge#:~:text=Gravity%20bridge%20is%20Cosmos,chain%20and%20back%20to%20Ethereum.) is a bi-directional bridge to the Ethereum network designed to run on the Cosmos network for maximum speed, efficiency and security.&nbsp; With Gravity Bridge, ERC20 based tokens can be transferred to Cosmos chains and back to Ethereum.&nbsp; The ability to transfer a Cosmos asset to the Ethereum network is in development and should be made available soon.\\n\\nCosmos secures over 140 billion USD in capital across 40+ applications and services and is growing all the time.&nbsp; Just like a port city or Country may be measured by its value and velocity of trade or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Cosmos will be valued by the amount of trade and liquidity that flows through it.&nbsp; IBC will facilitate all of this by making it the standard protocol by which sovereign blockchains connect.&nbsp; Cosmos and IBC interoperability will facilitate the internet of blockchains, which ensures transfer of value will continue to grow for a long time to come.\\n\\n### Closing\\n\\nCosmos has a grand vision, building and connecting decentralized blockchain applications and services. Like a night sky filled with stars, we map the Cosmos with constellations such as Leo, Taurus and Orion.&nbsp; IBC is what connects blockchains, like stars connected in a constellation.&nbsp; IBC is the glue that\u2019s building and connecting the Cosmos network to sovereign blockchains.&nbsp; It\u2019s the protocol that\u2019s enabling the internet of Blockchains.&nbsp; Imagine that for a second.&nbsp; What value does or will the internet of blockchains have?\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;IBC: What You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Welcome to IBC 101.

Akash\u2019s peer-to-peer marketplace offers Polygon developers a cost-effective option to deploy and scale their applications and services while Polygon provides [a starter kit](https://polygontechnology.notion.site/Polygon-Starter-Kit-a289a505a0bb4e8b8189c1fc3b2223d0) to developers including instructions for hosting on Akash Network.\\n\\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), is a full-stack scaling solution built to improve Ethereum by processing transactions in a more efficient fashion and connecting different blockchains. This provides a way for developers to let their decentralized applications, or dApps, work across different blockchains.\\n\\n### **Making dApps More Decentralized**\\n\\nThe benefit of moving to Akash is that decentralized application (dApp) developers can deploy their existing software faster and at scale while eliminating their reliance on a single cloud provider.\\n\\nBy running their dApps across multiple cloud providers, developers break free of the vendor lock-in and constantly changing terms of service associated with the traditional cloud companies. The lower costs on Akash Network bring welcomed cost-savings, making it an easy decision for developers who are tied to the centralized internet giants, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.\\n\\nMost cloud-native applications running on the cloud today can run on Akash Network.\\n\\nFor end-users, this promises to result in more dApps that are \u201cfully decentralized\u201d and more robust. Should a provider shut down, dApps can quickly spin up a new container deployment on a different provider. Thanks to Akash Network, the steps to switch cloud providers are closing a deployment and then creating a new lease. The deposit is returned immediately, and the only fees incurred are signing the blockchain transactions. Akash lets you set the price, length of lease, and terms of your deployment.\\n\\n### **Web3 and DeFi Working Together**\\n\\nMore than 70% of Polygon\u2019s 700 dApps are related to decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide investing, lending, and other financial services. Developers are also building dApps for gaming, collecting (NFTs), social platforms, blogs, and more.\\n\\nDeFi companies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are a natural fit for the Akash Network. Like DeFi and DAOs, Akash is founded on the principle of permissionless, open access and does not decide who can use the marketplace. Akash is a community-driven open-source project that allows anyone to contribute.\\n\\n### **The Akash Polygon-athon**\\n\\nDubbed the Akash Polygon-athon, Akash has launched a new program specifically for dApps running on Polygon\u2019s network. All developers in the Polygon ecosystem are now incentivized to migrate away from the traditional cloud providers and move their back-end and front-end services to the Akash Network.\\n\\n- Akash is offering 20 $AKT to any Polygon ecosystem project to cover the cost of hosting on Akash. If you are a developer, check out the [Polygon Starter Kit](https://akashnet.notion.site/Polygon-Akash-Starter-Kit-d4e817023556417ea8c9b679336d0d76) to get started.\\n\\n- To put things in perspective, this covers roughly 2-3 months of hosting costs for an application with 4 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 1 GB of storage - OR - up to 20 microservices.\\n\\n- Akash will _**match**_ bounties posted by Polygon projects - up to 100 $AKT. If a project offers a bounty of 100 $AKT or more, Akash will match the bounty with an additional 100 $AKT, and the person hired to the bounty will be awarded 200 $AKT.\\n\\n- Polygon apps can immediately post a bounty on the Akash Bounty Board ([click here](https://forum.akash.network/c/bounties/)) to hire engineers to help them with the DevOps effort of migration and hosting on Akash.\\n\\n- Bounties by projects can be paid in any currency. Matching awards by Akash will be paid in $AKT.\\n\\nFurther, developers are encouraged to apply for up to $100,000 from the Akash Developer Grant Program, which will be welcoming projects running on Polygon. Support for Polygon dApps will be funded through a bounty hosted by Akash and Gitcoin. Visit the [Akash Community Forum](https://forum.akash.network/c/hackathons/polygon/56) to learn how to apply for the program.\\n\\nIf you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon developer.

Let's start from the foundations and take a look at what the cloud really is and why it's important for everyone online.\\n\\nWhile the term \\&quot;the cloud\\&quot; is fairly new, the concept goes back a long way, to the earliest days of computing, in fact, when computers were room-sized machines that you had to access via specialized terminals elsewhere in the building. However, it wasn't until about 20 years ago that the modern concept of working and communicating online came about.\\n\\n### Who needs servers?\\n\\nAt that time broadband was becoming more common and people were learning just how powerful the web could be (turns out AOL wasn't all that great). But to offer services online, companies needed to invest in _servers_: specialized computers dedicated to handling Internet traffic. This expensive step was easy to get wrong, and a spotty or frustratingly slow web-based business might be worse than none at all.\\n\\nThe solution appeared in the form of _datacenters_, buildings full of servers all being operated by the same company as one giant machine, and instead of buying your own, you'd just rent time and space on theirs. The operators used software to quickly and efficiently delegate computing power to their customers, letting companies use just two servers one day and a hundred on the next if business took off.\\n\\nThis newfound reliability and flexibility led to the creation of some early cloud providers \u2014 though they didn't call themselves that quite yet \u2014 like what would later become the biggest of them all, Amazon Web Services (AWS). These companies made money by hosting and delivering data for their customers \u2014 from small businesses to equally large ones like Netflix.\\n\\nThere's an important distinction here between the cloud services that would soon be offered by AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure and the other things those companies did. Just because AWS or Azure hosts your data doesn't mean you have to list your product on Amazon's store or run Windows. The cloud services they offer were more like a utility, for the most part detached from their other products and competing with each other on price for processing power, storage, and traffic. This infrastructure is provided as a layer that's transparent for users \u2014 the only time anyone these days knows what cloud provider a website or service runs on is when one of them goes down and takes a quarter of the Internet with it.\\n\\n### From local apps to web apps\\n\\nAt first, these hosted services simply acted as more convenient places to quickly store and access bulky data. But before long it became clear that there was more to the opportunity than not having to run your own servers. In fact, the servers could do much of the work that home computers and phones were doing, with incredible benefits.\\n\\nThe poster child for this revelation, though it is far from alone, is certainly Gmail. For decades emails were something that went between computers, showing up in an application like Outlook that you opened on your computer, which had to be configured with a lot of technical details. Google showed the world that not only could email be done entirely in a browser, but that it was arguably superior to its desktop rivals.\\n\\nWhy? Think about it. Your inbox is now available at any computer you sit down at \u2014 all you do is go to gmail.com. Not only that, Gmail kept adding new features and expanding the already eye-popping gigabyte of storage each user was allowed \u2014 and no matter how big your attachments got, they never filled up _your_ hard drive.\\n\\nWhat do all these features have in common? They only became possible because the entire application lived full-time on Google's servers. Nothing depended on the user whatsoever: desktop or laptop, Mac or Windows, Chrome or Firefox... well, at the time it was probably Netscape or Internet Explorer, but you get the idea.\\n\\nGmail is just one example of the thousands of new markets and business opportunities that were created by the capability of letting someone else's computer do all the hard work, while the user just gets the results. This model was so promising that practically the entire digital economy would soon be built on it.\\n\\n### Digital transformation hits the gas\\n\\nThat's good, because as time went on people started storing a _lot_ more data online. [By one estimate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/09/a-very-short-history-of-big-data/), the world produced about 1.5 exabytes of data in total in 1999. (Your phone might have 100 gigabytes of space, your laptop perhaps ten times that, a terabyte \u2014 a petabyte is a thousand of those, and an exabyte is a thousand of _those_). By 2006 this had increased by an order of magnitude to 160 exabytes yearly. Over the next decade it would increase even faster, and these days we are producing [hundreds of exabytes](https://blog.iotechnologies.com/data-utilization-research/) _every single day_.\\n\\nAs for the money involved, in 2008 the cloud computing market was worth perhaps $6 billion or so, not pocket change by any means but only a tiny fraction of what was to come: cloud services in 2021 are a market worth well over $300 billion and growing faster than ever, [according to Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cloud-services-market).\\n\\nWhat happened? The world moved online, and everything online is part of \\&quot;the cloud\\&quot; in some way or another. From business services to social media to TV and movies, everything began to live in datacenters, and because no one wants to think about which server exactly or at what datacenter \u2014 even network engineers may not know for sure where their company's data is physically \u2014 everyone started just calling it \\&quot;the cloud.\\&quot; Something vague yet omnipresent.\\n\\n### The cloud and Big Tech&nbsp;\\n\\nAs the market grew, leaders emerged \u2014 and they're exactly who you'd expect. Microsoft's Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Google Cloud were among the first to invest in the space and offer cloud-native services, and with that first-mover advantage, they have steadily advanced until they completely dominated the cloud landscape.\\n\\nOn one hand, this is a good thing: large, well-known companies are likely to provide a variety of useful and reliable services easily accessible to businesses looking to host their own platforms. If you want to start an on-demand video service, you don't have to spend hundreds of millions on a datacenter, you just call up Amazon and tell them how much bandwidth you need. In fact, that's pretty much what Netflix did! (There's more to it than that, obviously, but that's a story for another time.)\\n\\nBut it also comes with risks. Having the cloud infrastructure owned by a handful of big tech companies means innovation can suffer while the market stagnates and becomes more siloed. Like any industry, if there are only a handful of players, and they're printing money, there's little incentive to truly change the product on offer, and instead, they compete on things like customer retention and upselling. Meanwhile, prices won't decline as fast as they would with more competition: Amazon, as pointed out by Cloudflare recently, seems to be marking up its own bandwidth costs [by almost 8,000 percent](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/) \u2014 at a time when bandwidth is cheaper than ever.\\n\\nIt's a trade-off we often see in growing industries: it's not quite a monopoly, and it's not quite price-fixing, but it's certainly not the robust competition that produces the best results for consumers and businesses. When you spend half of your 8 or 9 figures of revenue on cloud services, you tend to start wondering [whether it's worth it to build that datacenter after all](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/).\\n\\n### Cloudy present, cloudy future\\n\\nWhether you're shopping, consuming media like shows or music, or doing a video call with friends (something that of course became far more common during the pandemic), you are using cloud services every step of the way: when you browse, when you stream, when you pay, when you ask for help.\\n\\nPractically every service that needs to happen online has migrated to the cloud in one sense or another. This has produced enormous increases in productivity in some ways, but also creates new risks as personal and financial data flows between those services \u2014 and opportunities to protect that data. And of course, the challenge that started it all \u2014 getting enough servers to do the job right \u2014 is a constant challenge even for the mega-corporations vying with each other for the market.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Architecture Series Part I: The Cloud&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything we do today on the Internet leverages \u201cthe cloud.\u201d The term has become so ubiquitous it can be hard to understand exactly what the cloud is, how it works, and how we interact with it.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Kelsey Ruiz&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.B4cnl79M.gif&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,500],&quot;height&quot;:[0,276],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;gif&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/architecture-series-part-i-the-cloud/banner-image.gif&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-the-permaweb-hackathon/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-the-permaweb-hackathon&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nWhen you buy an NFT how do you know it is going to be around in 20 years? Who is paying to store it? NFTs are non-fungible tokens that grant ownership of unique items like art, music, digital items in a game, or real-world objects. Generative NFTs are especially popular as they transform strings of data stored in the token into colorful digital images of [Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), [Punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Mondrians](https://paulstamatiou.com/how-i-made-50k-in-3-days-with-nfts/), even the [cover of Rolling Stone\u2019s](https://hypebeast.com/2021/11/rolling-stone-bored-ape-yacht-club-digital-cover-nfts-announcement) magazine. While the actual tokens define ownership, they do not store the actual images on the blockchain. More often than not, the artwork is stored somewhere out of your control - or on a server that could shut down or suffer from data corruption.\\n\\nThe Akash Network is ideal for producing generative art, but a more permanent solution is needed to store your NFTs. Akash Network is a cloud platform that offers containers with _**ephemeral**_ storage, and data stored in containers are not meant to be stored long-term. _**Persistent**_ storage is on the [Akash Roadmap](https://akash.network/roadmap) and will add the ability for data to persist between restarts, ideal for data-intensive workloads such as blockchain nodes.\\n\\n> \u201cAs seen with the NFT gaming platform, Strange Clan, powered by Akash, we\u2019ve seen real-world use cases that leverage Akash\u2019s distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute. We\u2019re excited to partner with Arweave and ArDrive to enable NFT creators and collectors to create generative art and store the NFTs permanently on Arweave using ArDrive.\u201d\\n>\\n> Greg Osuri, CEO at Akash Network\\n\\nWhen it comes to choosing storage services for your NFT, the most important factors are durability and availability. Availability is a measure of hardware redundancy while durability is a measure of data redundancy. Amazon S3 \u201cboasts\u201d an availability of 99.99% which translates to over 8 hours downtime per year. Durability is the ability for data to be protected from corruption and \u201cbit rot\u201d over the long term. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes have annual failure rates that range between 0.1% - 0.2% every year. For every 1000 Amazon EBS volumes that you provision in a year, you can expect one or two of them to fail.\\n\\n### Meet the Permaweb&nbsp;\\n\\n[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) is a decentralized data storage protocol that allows you to store documents and applications in perpetuity on a permanent internet \u2014 the permaweb. The protocol matches people who have hard drive space to spare with those individuals and organizations that need to store data or host content permanently. All data stored is backed by an [endowment](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment) ensuring it is available in perpetuity. You can read an introduction to Arweave and the _**permaweb**_ [here](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/the-permaweb). Arweave is a completely community-owned and operated open-source network. The Arweave network is powered by the AR token, which can be found on most major exchanges.\\n\\n> \u201cWe are very excited to see support for Arweave and ArDrive grow in the Akash ecosystem. Persistent state between VM executions is a critical issue in the space -- and we are thrilled to see this being addressed with Arweave.\u201d\\n>\\n> Sam Williams\\n\\n[ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/) is a permanent storage platform whose [applications and core libraries](https://github.com/ardriveapp/) offer hierarchical organization, privacy via complete end-to-end encryption, flexibility, extensibility, and access control over your most valuable data, all made possible by its underlying core technology, the [Arweave File System (ArFS) Protocol](https://ardrive.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/help/pages/278495281/Arweave+File+System). ArDrive is a fantastic way to [store NFT data durably and permanently](https://ardrive.io/nft/) on Arweave.\\n\\n> \\&quot;ArDrive is the critical layer bridging the existing models that users and data systems rely upon to organize and access their data with the transaction-oriented, decentralized, and cryptographically secure Arweave Permaweb. ArDrive-powered, durable storage for Akash compute systems and bootstrap workflows are a natural fit and an exciting opportunity. The ArDrive Community is ready to support, and eager to celebrate the innovations developed by the Challengers!\\&quot;\\n>\\n> Ariel Melendez, Chief Technology Officer at ArDrive\\n\\n### Durable NFT Challenge\\n\\nAkash Network, Arweave Protocol, and ArDrive are partnering to offer a prize to open source projects to utilize building blocks from the Akash and ArDrive ecosystems to create an amazing NFT-related integration. NFT creators and collectors can create generative art using Akash\u2019s compute marketplace and store the NFTs permanently on Arweave using ArDrive.\\n\\nThe winner of the PermaNFT Challenge will receive 1,000 AKT and 10AR, equivalent to 20GB of perma-storage. The runner-up will receive 100 AKT and 2.5AR, equivalent to 5GB of perma-storage.\\n\\n### Bootstrap Challenge\\n\\nSnapshots and Bootstrap images for Akash deploys, backed by ArDrive. Use the [ArDrive CLI](https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-cli/) (Node.js) to create an app, service, or workflow integration that can take automatic, permanent backups of Akash Databases, Docker Snapshots, and/or Bootstrap Images to public or private drives on ArDrive. Alternatively, or in addition, create an app, service, or workflow integration that can retrieve backups from ArDrive of key Akash entities and/or data and deploy or restore them to Akash.\\n\\nThe winner of the Bootstrap Challenge will receive 1,000 AKT and 10AR, equivalent to 20GB of perma-storage. The runner up will receive 100 AKT and 2.5AR, equivalent to 5GB of perma-storage.\\n\\n### Filesystem Challenge\\n\\nFilesystems are critical for containers. [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) is an interface for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. Create a FUSE integration for a Linux-based Akash container that utilizes ArDrive as its FUSE backend. Use the [ArDrive CLI](https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-cli/) (Node.js - Typescript) or [ArDrive Core Library](https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-core-js) (Node.js - Typescript) to build your integration.\\n\\nThe winner of the Filesystem Challenge will receive 1,000 AKT and 10AR, equivalent to 20GB of perma-storage. The runner-up will receive 100 AKT and 2.5AR, equivalent to 5GB of perma-storage.\\n\\n### How to Participate\\n\\nTo compete in the challenge, submit your work to the [Akash-Arweave Challenge](https://forum.akash.network/c/bounties/arweave/) on the Akash Community Forum.

As part of that partnership, we challenged our community to build the best app that integrates Filebase and Akash, offering $10,000 in $AKT and $250 in free object storage.\\n\\nOver the course of the two-month-long hackathon, we received 16 total projects and were amazed with the quality and creativity of each one. Below are the top 3 projects that came out on top.&nbsp;\\n\\n### **3rd - QR-Share by zjor**\\n\\nQR-Share is an app that allows you to instantly share a photo or file from mobile to mobile, or from PC to mobile.\\n\\nFirst, you upload a file to Filebase S3 which gives you a public URL that is then generated into a QR-code. This allows you to share a photo with people in its original quality without adding them to your contacts which can be useful at public events or in large group settings.&nbsp;\\n\\nSimple, elegant, and useful. This thoughtful use of Filebase and Akash displays the power that technologies like Pastebin pioneered. Taking this to the next level with QR codes and file downloading this tool has real-world applications that thoroughly impressed the judges.\\n\\nClick [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/qr-share-on-akash-filebase/2892/7) to see the full submission and [here](https://qrshare.io/) to check out the QR-Share app.&nbsp;\\n\\n### **2nd - Akash Filebase AI/ML DeCloud Platform by SpacePotato**&nbsp;\\n\\n> \u201cMachine learning and AI require lots of storage (for storing data, model checkpoints, production models, etc.) and lots of compute (for experimenting with and training different models, serving the models in production, etc.). Filebase and Akash respectively provide both at a fraction of the cost of their centralized counterparts, but there is no AI/ML platform to take advantage of them right now. Let\u2019s change that.\u201d &nbsp;\\n> \\n> SpacePotato\\n\\nIntroducing The Akash Filebase AI/ML DeCloud Platform.&nbsp;\\n\\nKey features of this project include:&nbsp;\\n\\n*   Users will be able to specify and deploy a custom compute instance that comes with a hosted Jupyter notebook environment at the click of a button.\\n    \\n*   Within their Jupyter environment, users will be able to load datasets from Filebase S3 and train their models. Model checkpoints and final models will also be uploaded to Filebase. Users can close their Jupyter deployment and the models will still be available from Filebase.\\n    \\n*   From the web interface, users will be able to see all their models saved to Filebase. There will be a UI that allows users to pick a model to deploy as an endpoint, so that consuming ML apps can use the endpoint to perform model inference.\\n    \\n\\nNot only did this project impress the Filebase and Akash teams, but community members loved it too.&nbsp;\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1635481067-screen-shot-2021-10-28-at-5-45-45-pm.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1635481107-screen-shot-2021-10-28-at-5-45-19-pm.png)\\n\\nCheck out the full project, [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/akash-filebase-ai-ml-decloud-platform/2588/8).&nbsp;\\n\\n### **1st - The Akashian Public Library by Rodrigo Rochin**\\n\\nThe Akashian Public Library is a platform that allows anyone to find interesting copyright. This includes free books, comics, documents, media and information, and accessing the library is completely free.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1635481144-screen-shot-2021-10-28-at-5-24-20-pm.png)\\n\\nThere is also a calendar with important events related to Akash, Filebase, blockchain and tech.

The implications of this technology have far-reaching consequences and represent a revolution that is spreading into new areas and causing significant innovation.\\n\\nWhether or not you are directly impacted by crypto today, there is a high likelihood that you will be in the future. Explaining the full significance of the phenomenon would be impossible in a short blog post.\\n\\n#### **What Can Crypto Do For You?**\\n\\nHere is a list of potential benefits that cryptocurrency can offer you, as a user:\\n\\n- Earn a living buying, swapping, selling cryptocurrencies.\\n- Earn passive income, compounding interest and high yields through a wide variety of \u201cDecentralized Finance\u201d (DeFi) technologies.\\n- Purchase digital property which can accumulate significantly in value via NFTs.\\n- Effortlessly and rapidly transfer value to people in your network instantly.\\n- Buy real-world items with your earnings such as houses, cars or travel.\\n- Get a job working for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that pays you based on your contributions and output rather than your credentials or job title.\\n- Create and sell digital goods and profit from them in new ways, without any \u201cmiddlemen\u201d taking the majority of your profit.\\n\\n#### **Regulatory and Legal Concerns**\\n\\nIf you follow the conversation around Cryptocurrencies on social media, you will receive mixed signals. Some people think Crypto is all a giant scam. Others believe they will be regulated out of existence. Still, others think that cryptocurrencies only offer value to criminals in the form of money laundering (or worse). Finally, a large and passionate group of dreamers believe that cryptocurrencies are a true revolution that will completely reshape the modern world for the better.\\n\\nThe reality is that cryptocurrencies are a permanent shift in the fundamental nature of money and will disrupt the entire world economy. The speed of innovation and creativity of entrepreneurs working in crypto has shown that this is an innovation with far-reaching and permanent consequences. Regulatory activity tends to follow technological innovation, and global governments are responding by adapting to this change with new laws and regulations.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies unlock many new types of financial transactions not previously possible for individuals. With cryptocurrencies, it is possible to take out loans against funds stored in a DAO, for example. I recommend reading up on the topic of taxes for cryptocurrencies or loans extensively before engaging in any significant activity. [Here are some guides to get started](https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/#:~:text=If%20you%20lend%20your%20crypto,depends%20on%20your%20DeFi%20platform.).\\n\\nFor the most part, the simple \u201cbuying and selling\u201d of cryptocurrencies are all you need to worry about and these are taxed using standard calculations. It is important, however, to have some understanding of the regulatory and tax environment in advance. A common practice is to keep [a spreadsheet of any trading activities to track cost-basis for tax purposes](https://www.zenledger.io/blog/tracking-cost-basis-across-wallets-exchanges). There is a growing ecosystem of services to help automate tax tracking such as [ZenLedger](https://www.zenledger.io/).\\n\\n#### **Step 1: Get A Wallet (And Lock It Down)**\\n\\nThe starting point for most people\u2019s journeys into crypto will begin with setting up a wallet to store their funds in. There are dozens of wallets available. Below are a few interesting ones worth investigating:\\n\\n- Klever (really simple, easy to use iOS wallet)\\n- MetaMask (works with a very wide range of the decentralized applications (dApps) out there)\\n- Trust Wallet\\n- Coinbase Wallet\\n- Ledger\\n- Crypto.coin\\n- Keplr\\n\\nDepending on which tokens or coins you want to experiment with, you may need to download or make use of different wallets. [You can find a recent list of wallets here](https://theislandnow.com/blog-112/2021s-best-bitcoin-wallet-cryptocurrency-wallets/).\\n\\nThere are also \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d wallets. A \u201chot wallet\u201d is a wallet that is connected actively to the internet and enables transfer into and out of it via a connected service. A \u201ccold\u201d wallet is a wallet that is stored offline. In most situations, \u201ccold\u201d wallets are a measure taken to avoid hacking or theft of the funds being stored. Hot wallets are considered to be less secure and more prone to hacking or theft. [You can read more about wallet security here](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-safe-storage-cold-wallet/).\\n\\n#### **Step 2: Get Money Into The Cryptoverse**\\n\\nGetting money into the cryptoverse is often burdensome and time-consuming. Many banks may not make it easy to shift dollars into cryptocurrency exchanges. It can take as long as 10+ days or more to initiate a bank transfer in some cases. In many cases, you will need to provide a government ID (called a KYC or Know Your Customer check).\\n\\nOnce your money is in the system, things get easier and much more instantaneous. The best way to get money into the cryptoverse is often via an exchange. There are many to choose from. [You can see the list of largest exchanges here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)\\n\\n#### **Step 3: Purchase and Swapping of Coins**\\n\\nOnce your funds are in an exchange, you can either purchase coins directly or shift your funds from the exchange into one of your wallets. You can either choose to keep your money in an exchange or move it to one of your wallets. Once in a wallet, you can often swap the coin for other coins that look interesting using a variety of built-in or decentralized services.\\n\\nA big area of development is in swapping and moving coins from one blockchain ecosystem to another. Decentralized Liquidity Providers such as Uniswap have become popular which allows users to readily exchange one token for another (with a fee). There are also a group of services building \u201cbridges\u201d between ecosystems to enable users to shift their coins from one ecosystem to another.\\n\\n#### **Step 4: Researching Coins &amp; Tokens**\\n\\nHere is where the complexity and speed of innovation in the cryptocurrency space become a challenge for anyone wanting to get started. A general filter I use when evaluating coins to invest in looks like this:\\n\\n- Strong social media activity and engaged founder.\\n- The rapid rate of innovation, constantly pushing out new updates.\\n- Strong community activity on Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Twitter.\\n- Not redundant tech (there are a million \u201cliquidity provider\u201d types, for example).\\n- Does the coin offer additional features such as staking or deflationary benefits?\\n- Look for a direct relationship with a major exchange (often important).\\n- Interesting and unique technology that solves a real problem.\\n- Strong partnerships and deal-making.\\n- Has a unique story or advantage.\\n\\nHere is how I decide what to buy:\\n\\n- I follow the coin on Reddit, Telegram, Discord, Twitter.\\n- I check the community activity, what are they talking about, is there anything disqualifying that I see immediately?\\n- I read the Reddit for that coin and learn about any upcoming news or announcements.\\n- Try to gauge if the community is insane or not, many of the communities tend to be highly delusional or only focused on price. If they do not have rational reasons for buying and holding, I avoid it.\\n- Check the Coinmarket cap for the coin, is it sub $1 billion dollars? Or less? I like to buy coins that have a market cap in the hundreds of millions before they \u201cbreak out.\u201d\\n\\nThere is no wrong answer for what to buy or how to go about selecting tokens or coins to invest in.\\n\\n#### **Understanding Different Algorithms and Blockchains**\\n\\nAn important thing to understand about the current cryptocurrency ecosystem is that there are many blockchain ecosystems. A few prominent ones:\\n\\n- Ethereum\\n- Bitcoin\\n- Binance\\n- Solana\\n- Cardano\\n- Cosmos\\n- Tron\\n\\nEach of these blockchains represents fundamentally different approaches to solving the challenge of digital currency. Each of these blockchains also has spawned dozens or hundreds of tokens based on their respective ecosystems.\\n\\nIn crypto terminology, a \u201cCoin\u201d tends to be the fundamental unit of a Blockchain such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana etc. A \u201cToken\u201d is a unit of exchange based on someone else\u2019s blockchain. For example, Ethereum has thousands of Tokens such as UNI (Uniswap) based on its ERC-20 standard.\\n\\n#### **Some Terms You Might Encounter**\\n\\n- \u201cWrapped Token\u201d A coin from one blockchain that has been packaged for sale on another blockchain. For example, I could buy \u201cWrapped Bitcoin\u201d using Ethereum so I can buy, hold and sell Bitcoin without actually leaving the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n- \u201cUtility Token\u201d A token that can be used for something. For example, you could buy AVA token from Travala and use it to get discounts on travel.\\n- \u201cBridge\u201d A big challenge in the crypto space is translating tokens or coins from one blockchain to another as there are frequently significant technological differences. Bridged allow you to do this.\\n- \u201cOracle\u201d An oracle, in the crypto space, is a program that read a datafeed from the \u201creal world\u201d and transports it into the crypto world. For example, Mirror Protocol uses Oracles or Observers to track the prices of stocks like Tesla and convert them into assets which you can buy and sell that track Tesla stock in crypto space\\n- \u201cCBDC\u201d Central Bank Digital Currency. These are coins issued by governments to represent their local currency. Increasingly, major governments are considering using these as replacements for their previous systems\\n- \u201cStable Coin\u201d This is a token or coin which is designed to track the value of $1 or other similar currency. Stable Coins come in many shapes and sizes and are often used as convenient stand-ins for dollars which can be used instead of transferring money into and out of the cryptoverse\\n- \u201cSmart Contract\u201d A piece of code which lives on the blockchain and can be used to execute programmatic behavior\\n- \u201cLiquidity Provider\u201d A service which incentivizes users to make their tokens available as the basis for \u201cLiquidity Pools.\u201d These liquidity pools make it possible to ensure there is always ample of supply for rarer tokens to be \u201cSwapped\u201d for other tokens.\\n- \u201cDAO\u201d A decentralized autonomous organization. It has become increasingly popular to launch autonomous organizations which are run programmatically in a distributed fashion. A popular example is the MakerDAO\\n- \u201cdApps\u201d Decentralized Applications which live on the blockchain and can perform various programmatic functions\\n- \u201cDeFi\u201d Decentralized Finance, a growing movement towards shifting finance to smart contracts, DAOs, blockchains and dApps\\n- \u201cNFT\u201d Non-Fungible Token. A token which represents a digital good such as a JPEG. Ownership of an NFT is tracked via the blockchain, they can be bought and sold\\n\\n#### **Closing Thoughts**\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for now. Once again, this is a rapidly evolving space and new innovations and trends are occurring every day. I recommend spending significant time joining and researching the many online chats and communities available to gain a more recent understanding and keep your knowledge up to speed with the market.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Crypto 101&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Why Does Crypto Matter?&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-10-21T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;],[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;AkashDudeBro&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CrYlfTCk.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1024],&quot;height&quot;:[0,532],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/crypto-101/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-partners-with-kava-labs-to-provide-decentralized-hosting-for-the-ka/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-partners-with-kava-labs-to-provide-decentralized-hosting-for-the-ka&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network has been selected by Kava Labs as the preferred distributed cloud hosting solution for the Kava Ecosystem.

New deployments have averaged about 200 per day for several weeks, with active deployments steadily increasing, and we're proud to have crossed the 25,000 milestone in total deployments.&nbsp;\\n\\nMost recently, to make the provider/tenant relationship more seamless, we released the [Akash Provider Upgrade (v0.14)](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.14.1-rc0) that allows end-users to troubleshoot their deployments and includes other essential features that improve provider performance.\\n\\nThe possibilities of building on Akash are endless. Our approach is to identify a community where Akash\u2019s value proposition can be communicated clearly, increase awareness, and improve user experience by building onboarding tools to gain adoption within the community.\\n\\nAt the present, we have a solid platform optimized for builders and have seen the emergence of community tools like [Akashlytics](https://akashlytics.com/) and [Deploy Tool](https://akashdeploy.hns.siasky.net) that bring in a steady set of users with a simplified graphical user interface (GUI). And, with [Akash Omnibus](https://github.com/ovrclk/cosmos-omnibus), where one can launch a scalable proof of stake (PoS) node network in just a few steps, we saw impressive growth and adoption within the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Additionally, community-generated content such as this [Guide to Mining PKT on Akash at Scale](https://youtu.be/GBXEzDu5JYE) takes users one step further into the power of mining on Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\nScaling this approach to broader use cases such as machine learning will impact Akash\u2019s growth exponentially.\\n\\nThis [roadmap](https://akash.network/roadmap) is how we get there.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Product Roadmap 2022&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Since the launch of Akash Network, a distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute, we\u2019ve been hyper-focused on stability while pursuing product-market fit.

We are seeing strong and consistent growth since releasing Akash\u2019s distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute in March.&nbsp;\\n\\nNew deployments have been averaging about 200 per day for several weeks, active deployments are steadily increasing, and we crossed the 25,000 deployments milestone in just six months.&nbsp;\\n\\n[The adoption](https://akashlytics.com/) continues to grow, with developer tooling, guides, and integrations rising alongside deployments. Akash is meeting a real market demand at [a fraction of the cost](https://akashlytics.com/price-compare) of centralized cloud services.\\n\\nToday, we are at a critical phase in Akash's growth\u2014one that sometimes includes pivots to our path forward to ensure the long-term success of the network, so we are postponing the Akash Supermini. While I know many of you have been eagerly anticipating the Supermini, this is a situation where a good idea came at the wrong time.\\n\\n> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\\n> \\n> Steve Jobs\\n\\nIn October of 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic put the entire world on pause, we demonstrated the flexibility of our platform by running Akash's software on a low-power ARM-based Raspberry Pi. The \u201cAkash Pi\u201d was the genesis of the Akash Supermini. Engineering teams around the world use Pis for testing, running scripts, and even acting as servers on test networks. The Pi is a versatile device, but we knew the market wanted something with high performance for running machine-learning workloads and supporting production applications.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe set out to design a miniature supercomputer for the home office, a powerful machine that you could use to offload heavy workloads and rent to others looking for high-performance compute. The Supermini's design was fit for the home office, and the spec sheet of its hardware included a powerful GPU. We believed that a GPU was critical to support machine learning. Since we needed to explore the viability of the Supermini both technically and economically, we planned to make just 300 units.\\n\\nWe intended the Supermini to be a consumer-focused appliance that would enable almost anyone to enjoy the benefits of cloud computing while maintaining data sovereignty. Excess compute from Supermini could be contributed to Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud to support the network and earn passive income in AKT. This goal is still our long-term intention, but as Akash has grown over the last couple years, we found that introducing the Supermini now would be premature for four key reasons.\\n\\n#### **The Market has Spoken**\\n\\nFirst, the market is demanding a different product, and we are responding to the massive growth in deployments on our network. We have seen impressive growth, reaching the first hundred daily application deployments in 120 days, but the next hundred in less than 30. Now we are seeing roughly a doubling of deployed applications every month. A few star applications like [Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/) and [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) (a decentralized S3 alternative) live on Akash\u2019s open-source decentralized cloud, and ShapeShift is considering using Akash for its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).&nbsp;\\n\\nWe are in a crucial phase of building application reliance on Akash, particularly for workloads that have no real alternatives among centralized providers, such as data services for DAOs. We are still early in our journey, but Akash is maturing quickly, both technologically and in the diverse set of applications that require a permissionless, decentralized cloud. As reliance on Akash grows, we will be better positioned to reconsider the Supermini to take full advantage of its utility and powerful use case.\\n\\n#### **Technical Support**\\n\\nThe second reason is technical. GPU support on Akash is still under development, and this feature is necessary to make the Supermini profitable for its users. Until we roll out GPU functionality, the Supermini simply would not work as intended. In order for the Supermini to be viable, Akash needs multitenant GPU infrastructure, and we are several months away from testing and deploying that functionality. Right now, Akash supports CPUs, storage, and memory. Building out bandwidth marketplaces and working around the limitations of home bandwidth also need to be deployed before the Supermini could work properly. We strongly believe it would be better not to launch a product that would leave customers waiting for the full functionality to be unleashed.\\n\\n#### **Economic Viability**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe third reason is economic. Today Akash is focused on converting data centers into Akash providers because it's more competitive than launching home-based hardware.\\n\\nOur number one risk is competition from datacenter compute. Why would anyone choose a Supermini over a compute cluster in a data center?&nbsp;\\n\\nWe can compete on cost, but we need a critical mass of users first to make contributing compute economically viable for the Supermini.\\n\\n#### **The Revolution Will Not Be Centralized**\\n\\nThe fourth reason is more philosophical. The Supermini is intended to be a managed product, a plug-and-play appliance. Our team would have directly managed firmware development and update deployment so that the Supermini owners would not need technical expertise. But as a result, releasing Supermini now would potentially introduce too much centralization to the network, which is against our ethos at Akash. Once Akash is more fully built out, the risks posed by a centrally managed appliance like the Supermini will be diminished, but we are not there yet.\\n\\n#### **What's Next?**&nbsp;\\n\\nFor those of you who preordered a Supermini, we want to make sure that you are properly compensated for your enthusiasm and trust in our vision. We recognize that your deposit came with an opportunity cost that went beyond just the hundred dollars you spent, so for each Supermini unit reserved, you will be refunded in full plus an additional 100 AKT. We hope that this refund will do more than just give you back your money. We hope that it will demonstrate our commitment to Akash\u2019s bright future. You will be receiving an email to the address that was used to place your order with reimbursement details and instructions on claiming your AKT.\\n\\n#### **Onward and Upward**\\n\\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Akash is gaining momentum, and we will continue capitalizing on that. Later down the road, we can revisit the idea of the Supermini. It is still a good idea for the right time. But for now, we will be pouring our energy into making sure that Akash fulfills its promise of a decentralized cloud ecosystem that is permissionless and censorship-resistant\u2014delivering data sovereignty to all.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Supermini Update&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We have an important announcement today, but first, I want to give a brief update on how Akash Network is progressing.

Although it has been around since the early 1990s, it isn't until now that many of us are seeing its real potential.&nbsp;\\n\\nBlockchain tech has been growing exponentially year after year and thanks to new developments, such as blockchain governance, we are going to see this technology change our world as we know it.\\n\\n### **Solving Real-World Problems**\\n\\nRight now, most people believe that blockchains are only about cryptocurrencies, NFT collectibles and public ledgers, but the reality is that this technology is capable of solving real life problems, such as health record management, identification management, supply chain, HR tools and a whole lot more.\\n\\nOne of the most important benefits of blockchain tech is its use as a governance tool or system. Blockchain governance can basically give any organization, any government, any business or any community, the tools and the fundamentals to become a transparent and true democracy.\\n\\nThroughout history, there have been many problems with different types of governments, companies and groups. Ambition, avarice and corruption, are only a few of the problems that can be solved by applying a blockchain governance system to an organization.&nbsp;\\n\\nThis technology basically allows all citizens, all stockholders or all members of a group, to cast their votes, to know exactly how many votes have been cast, and to propose new ideas or plans.\\n\\n### **How Does Blockchain Governance Work?**\\n\\nAs of today, we have two different types of blockchains, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).&nbsp;\\n\\nIn PoW blockchains, miners or nodes, are basically competing against each other, to try and solve a cryptographic puzzle before the others do. The miner or the node that deciphers that puzzle first will be awarded a specific amount of tokens.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn these types of blockchains, there is no blockchain governance and these are mostly used for financial or for speculation purposes.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn PoS blockchains, there are no miners.&nbsp; Instead, these blockchains have validator nodes, which work towards making sure that blockchain transactions are passed correctly.&nbsp;\\n\\nThese types of blockchains, require tokens to be held or staked within their ecosystems and this is how validators are able to prove each transaction.&nbsp;\\n\\nThere are different types of rewards for PoS blockchain validators and for the members who stake or delegate their tokens with them, but the people that do have their coins or tokens held within the blockchain, get to participate in the governance aspect of the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nAs it was mentioned before, any person who is part of a group, could be more involved in the decision-making process of any organization and thus, change the path that their group will take, as well as its results.&nbsp;\\n\\nBesides making the entire process extremely transparent, blockchain governance also helps to eliminate many of the problems that can come from immoral members of a group and in the end, this increases the probabilities of the group achieving their goals.&nbsp;\\n\\nInstead of using tokens or coins from a blockchain as currency or as collectibles, these can become a company stock or a share, a government ID, a membership card or something that identifies each individual of a group.&nbsp;\\n\\nJust as most of us use our government IDs to vote in our country\u2019s elections, these governance tokens give us the right to vote on any proposal or decision that needs to be made within our groups.\\n\\nNot only does this technology make the results of an election or proposal truly transparent, but it also solves other problems, like not needing to spend time and resources on counting votes, as the blockchain will take care of this almost instantly; it can also solve the problem of not enough members casting their votes, as this technology allows us to vote from our mobile devices or from our computers, without having to rely on transportation, without having to spend time waiting in lines and without having to do much effort at all.&nbsp;\\n\\nMaking it as easy as possible for all members of a group to cast their votes and allowing them to make their opinions and their values truly count, turns the process and the group into a real democracy.&nbsp;\\n\\nThis is without a doubt, one of the best methods for making each one of us, as equal and as important, as any of the other members of our groups.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn a few words, blockchain governance is the new democratic process or system, which simplifies voting and helps any group to achieve its goals.\\n\\n### **How Can I Participate in Blockchain Governance?**\\n\\nBeing part of blockchain governance is extremely easy.&nbsp; You only need to find a project or an organization that uses a PoS blockchain system, acquire some of its tokens and keep them in your wallet or delegate some of those tokens to a validator.\\n\\nEach project will have its own rules, its own rewards and its own processes, but by simply holding your tokens, you will have the right to cast your vote on proposals and to form part of the governance aspect of that project.&nbsp;\\n\\nEvery blockchain has some type of wallet or software that allows you to hold and store your tokens. Most of these wallets will have an option for you to participate in the blockchain governance and it is as easy as reading through the proposals, deciding how you want to cast your vote and finally pressing a button.&nbsp;\\n\\nAfter you have gone through the process once, you will have no problem doing it over and over again.&nbsp;  \\n\\n### **Will We See This Technology Impact Our World Soon?**\\n\\nBlockchain governance is already being used by different organizations and projects. The results that most of these are having, have exceeded expectations and they are proof that this technology is here to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nIt will not be long before more governments and more organizations start using this system to bring transparency and democracy to their road maps and to their goals.&nbsp;\\n\\nIt is extremely likely that most democratic governments will start using this technology within the next decade. It is also very likely that this technology will be a requirement for many organizations and for many groups within the next five years.&nbsp;\\n\\nIf you are still not part of blockchain governance, you will most likely have to be very soon.&nbsp;\\n\\nAlthough it may seem a little scary or a little difficult to understand at first, the reality is that it is very simple and that it is one of the most important use cases for blockchains, as well as one of the most important technologies that we will ever have.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Governance 101 &quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Blockchain technology is one of the most important innovations of our time.

Having a tangible product presented a whole new set of opportunities as well as learnings.&nbsp;\\n\\nFor the first time, developers were able to use and play with our software to deploy and host applications on Akash Network\u2019s open-source, distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute. As such, two of our main goals have been to drive growth and adoption of Akash Network, while supporting the evolution and architecture of the decentralized web (dWeb).\\n\\nThrough key partnerships, new listings, our global community, bounties, and new product features, we\u2019ve seen the number of active deployments [more than triple](https://akashlytics.com/) from 150 to 465 and a rapid increase in Akash Token (AKT) spend; positioning Akash to best support the future of the Internet.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631052654-screen-shot-2021-09-03-at-8-21-37-am.png)\\n\\n**Partnerships**&nbsp;\\n-----------------\\n\\nIn May, just after the launch of our platform, [we were selected to support the Helium Network](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akash-network-provides-decentralized-cloud-to-the-largest-internet-of-things-iot-network-helium-301300571.html), the largest peer-to-peer wireless internet-of-things (IoT) network by providing decentralized cloud compute for their new blockchain validators.&nbsp;\\n\\nLast month, through an [integration with Skynet](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-and-skynet-labs-provide-a-full-stack-for-the-unstoppable-web) and [a key partnership with Filebase](https://akash.network/blog/akash-and-filebase-replace-s3-with-multi-cloud-dweb-providers), we took major leaps forward when it comes to supporting the development of dWeb, making it easier for developers to build and host decentralized apps. By bringing together compute and storage layers, developers can now host their applications on a fully decentralized cloud.\\n\\n> \\&quot;The Filebase API is S3 compatible, which allows developers to seamlessly leverage multiple decentralized storage networks for the first time. We're excited to pair our S3 compatible access layer to decentralized storage networks, with the power and flexibility of Akash Network. We can't wait to see what our ecosystem builds through the pairing of dWeb compute and multi-cloud storage as one.\\&quot;\\n\\n> Joshua Noble, CEO, and Co-founder of Filebase\\n\\nMore recently, we began working with mining communities such as [pkt.cash](https://pkt.cash/), the world\u2019s first bandwidth-hard blockchain. Mining cryptocurrency on the cloud is much easier than building your own hardware. Cloud hosting usually comes at a higher cost and requires contracts, and service providers can charge extra fees for bandwidth usage. Making things more difficult, some cloud providers are shutting off mining operations at will. Crypto-mining projects like PKT, are looking for better cloud providers and now they can run on Akash Network.\\n\\nCheck out the video below to see this in action.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Listings**&nbsp;\\n-------------\\n\\nAKT is now on a total of 8 exchanges. This past quarter we announced listings on [BHEX](https://support.hbtc.co/hc/en-us/articles/900006734366-AKT-Akash-Network-) and [Bittrex Global](https://bittrex.com/home/markets) and are seeing an influx of decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear on the market that allows for fewer regulatory restrictions, lower transactions fees, and higher incentives.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Decentralized Exchanges**\\n\\nOur first DEX listing was [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools), an automated market maker (AMM) protocol built for liquidity providers, allowing users to earn rewards for providing liquidity. Users are now able to pair the Cosmos native coin, atom (ATOM), one of the most widely available tokens in the world, to AKT, significantly increasing access to our native token. This enables ATOM holders with the ability to swap their ATOM for AKT, increasing the incentives to buy and hold AKT by incentivizing liquidity pools with OSMO tokens for offering their AKT to the pool.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631052881-osmosisliquidity.png)\\n\\nHosted on Akash, Osmosis was a huge success with over $100-million in Total Locked Value in its first month.\\n\\n> \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Akash Network be one of the first launch partners of Osmosis. Akash Network enables a new generation of resilient, decentralized Internet infrastructure to be built, and Osmosis provides a gateway for anyone to take part in this decentralized economy. For Osmosis to be a truly decentralized exchange, we need to be built on a decentralized infrastructure. Osmosis will be a proud user of Akash infrastructure to host our applications and API-serving nodes.\u201d\\n\\n> Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis\\n\\nAnnounced earlier this month, AKT is now supported on a second decentralized exchange, [Emeris, a portal to cross-chain DeFi](https://app.emeris.com/pools). As one of the first tokens available on Emeris, users can now swap, transfer, pool and manage AKT across multiple chains. Emeris saw four million in Total Locked Value in less than a week.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631053001-emeris.png)\\n\\nAKT Liquidity on Cosmos cross-chain DEXs\u2019 has increased significantly in the past couple of months and, this is just the beginning.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Community**\\n-------------\\n\\nOur community is growing fast with over 80,000 members distributed all over the world. From the United States to Russia, China and Korea, we\u2019d like to thank everyone who has supported us along the way.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **The Akash Community Forum**\\n\\nThe [Akash Community Forum](https://forum.akash.network/) is our version of Stack Overflow. It's designed to help developers receive community support and share their technical expertise. Since our relaunch of the Forum, growth in membership has been incredible. We now have topics of conversation including validators, providers, miners, hackathons, bounties, and are seeing our community members interacting with one another and answering each other\u2019s questions.&nbsp;\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631053186-screen-shot-2021-09-03-at-9-07-07-am.png)\\n\\nIf you have been looking to find or provide community support check out the Akash Community Forum [here](https://forum.akash.network/).&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Akash is Global**&nbsp;\\n\\nWe've launched a few new global channels where our Chinese and Russian-speaking community members can connect with each other to receive updates about Akash.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631053221-dsc2944.png)\\n\\nTo connect with our Chinese community, check out [Bihu Coinbar](https://akt.bihu.com/), [Weibo](https://weibo.com/akashchina) and [QQ Group](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?k=xD-wcitwEnl3LkI0yah6FXWf5t13xuVw&amp;authKey=3Vu/z8JcpblJ7UirpWEUyhyuCMn9zEiro9exgNkPDFQ30bjyEw0uVodTO6MLhW0R&amp;noverify=0). To connect with our Russian community members, check out our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akash_ru) and [VK](https://vk.com/akash_ru).\\n\\n#### **Akash Insiders**\\n\\nWe've been busy onboarding a leadership community of 24 (and growing) developers, event organizers and creators to provide support and develop educational content for customers, developers, providers, and partners. The goal of the Insiders program is to support Akash advocates and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth. If you\u2019re interested in participating, [apply today](https://akash.network/community#insiders).\\n\\n#### **Developer Grants Program**\\n\\nTo drive the development of open-source projects and support the evolution of the dWeb, we launched the [Developer Grant Program](https://forum.akash.network/t/new-developer-grants-program-community-awards-board/541), a community-driven source of funding for promising developers and teams.&nbsp;\\n\\nOffering grants up to $100,000 in AKT, the Grant Program has already awarded over 100 developers in our first batch.\\n\\n**Hackathons, Challenges and Bounties** &nbsp;\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n#### **Solana Season Hackathon**&nbsp;\\n\\nTo progress our integration with Solana, we joined the [Solana Season Hackathon](https://solana.com/solanaszn), and presented a total of 4 challenges with a $15,000 AKT prize pot.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn first place, with a $10,000 prize (2,500 AKT) was the [Akash Deploy UI](https://github.com/tombeynon/akash-deploy) created by Tom Beynon and submitted by newsystem090 with a key improvement, Keplr wallet integration.&nbsp;\\n\\n> \u201cThe Akash Deploy UI makes it easier to manage multiple deployments on Akash in one place, your web browser.\u201d\\n> \\n> Tom Beynon\\n\\nClick [here](https://akash.network/blog/winners-of-the-akash-solana-hackathon) to see all of the great project submissions.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Sovrython, Powered by Gitcoin**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Sovrython was a 6-week long hackathon that invited developers from all chains to collaborate on decentralization/privacy, data science, integrations, and finance with a shared goal to accelerate the future of DeFi.\\n\\nWe committed $100,000 in $AKT to the winners of our three challenges which asked developers to:\\n\\n1.  Securely deploy the Sovryn node using Akash Network&nbsp;\\n    \\n2.  Design an easy-to-use UI to help developers deploy any app on Akash\\n    \\n3.  Build an app that leverages decentralized storage such as Skynet and run it on Akash\\n    \\n\\n&nbsp;From a decentralized container registry to an app that allows influencers to easily gift NFTs to their fans, we saw a lot of great projects. Click [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/everyone-s-a-winner-in-the-sovrynthon-hackathon/734) to see all submissions.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Skynet**&nbsp;\\n\\nFollowing our integration with Skynet Labs to provide the first full-stack dWeb solution to handle backup, restore, and migration, we hosted a challenge, offering $10,000 to the developer or team that builds the best app that integrates Skynet and Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\nOur first-place winner was SkyChat, a decentralized version of Discord. SkyChat uses MySky to let users login in a permissionless and decentralized way. With MySky, every user fully owns their key pair, which is the root of their decentralized identity.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo read more about how SkyChat works click [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/skychat-decentralized-alternative-to-discord-powered-by-skynet-and-akash/732/6).&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Filebase**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1631053395-filebase-hackathon-banner.png)\\n\\nLaunched just last week, we are currently running a Filebase challenge. With $10,000 in $AKT and $250 in free object storage, we\u2019re challenging our community to build the best app that integrates Filebase and Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\nClick [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/the-filebase-akash-hackathon/2332) if you\u2019d like to get involved.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Product**&nbsp;\\n------------\\n\\nOur core dev team has been hyper-focused on stabilizing the provider services and improving the deployment experience. Taking feedback from our users and working directly with the community, the core dev team made a few big feature updates, some small bug fixes, and launched developer tooling that allows non-technical users to deploy in 2 minutes or less.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Feature Updates**\\n\\n*   **Update #1231:** Enables Akash Network to support Apple\u2019s M1. See more, [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1231).&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Update #1232:** Provides prometheus metrics to the provider so they can get insights into how their Kubernetes cluster is running. See more, [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1232).&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Update #1251:** Allows hostname dash and SDL which allows people to use hyphens in their domains - something our community is very excited about! See more, [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1251).&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Update #1265**: Eliminates resource leaks causing out of memory. See more, [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1265).\\n    \\n\\n#### **Developer Tooling**\\n\\nLaunched by one of our developer partners, Maxime, the [Akashlytics Deploy tool](https://akashlytics.com/deploy) is a desktop app for Windows and Mac with an easy-to-use GUI for defining and deploying apps on Akash. Non-technical users are now deploying apps like WordPress and Minecraft on Akash in roughly 2 minutes.\\n\\n#### **Coming Soon**\\n\\nThe Faucet App -- think AWS credits. A project led by our Engineering lead, Derek Anderson, the Faucet app is designed to help distribute AKT and ease developer onboarding. The Faucet will distribute enough AKT for one free deployment so devs who are new to our ecosystem can try deploying on Akash.&nbsp;\\n\\nNext up is a brand new command-line interface (CLI). The new CLI, expected to launch at the end of mid-Fall, will be client-focused and project-based to help developers deploy, manage, and configure their applications.&nbsp;\\n\\n**What\u2019s Next?**\\n----------------\\n\\nAs we continue to improve the user experience on Akash Network and navigate the needs of our users, we are seeing accelerated growth in network usage and AKT spend.&nbsp;\\n\\nRecently, we\u2019ve even been running out of capacity due to the high demand, but don\u2019t worry, this is something our core dev team is continuously working on to bring more on, and as quickly as possible! As we start to see what can be considered just the beginning of product-market fit, our surge in growth validates what our CEO, Greg Osuri, and CTO, Adam Bozanich have been developing for more than five years.&nbsp;\\n\\nRespectively, [as pointed out by Ellio Trades](https://youtu.be/ejRC_1TgJFU), people are starting to realize the potential of the Cosmos ecosystem at large. Not only are we seeing the [Cosmos Market Cap](https://cosmos-cap.com/) continue to grow but earlier this year we saw the launch of Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) which enables blockchain protocols to communicate and transact with each other independently. Next up: cross-chain composability. According to Cointelegraph, \u201cthis would mean users with almost any decentralized holdings could easily use it as collateral to get involved with Decentralized Applications, or DApps, across all networks.\u201d&nbsp;\\n\\nAs Akash Network and the Cosmos ecosystem both continue to grow, we\u2019re primed to become the leading provider for decentralized cloud computing. With 100 percent month-over-month growth and a goal of 10,000 deployments by the end of the year, we\u2019re just getting started.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;End of Summer Update&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Following our mainnet 2 launch in March, this past summer was the first that we had a live, working product.

It\u2019s the primary method of settlement that enables users to buy and sell compute. As [network usage increases](https://akashlytics.com/), so does the demand for AKT.\\n\\nLast month, we announced [our first DEX listing on Osmosis](https://akash.network/blog/akt-token-launches-on-osmosis-the-first-decentralized-exchange-for-cosmos). This allowed users to pair Cosmos native coin, ATOM, one of the most widely available tokens in the world, to AKT. By enabling ATOM holders with the ability to swap their ATOM for AKT, users worldwide can now enjoy access to AKT while benefiting from the incentives from the liquidity pool. Osmosis was a huge success with over $100-million in Total Locked Value in its first month.&nbsp;\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce AKT is now supported on a second decentralized exchange, [Emeris](https://emeris.com/). A portal to cross-chain DeFi, Emeris is connected to [Gravity DEX](https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/), the first cross-chain DeFi protocol on the Cosmos Hub.\\n\\n> \\&quot;Emeris delivers an amazing experience that abstracts incredible complexity with cross-chain DeFi \u2014 a true portal for DeFi \u2014 powered by the Gravity DEX,\\&quot; said&nbsp;Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network. \\&quot;The protocol makes it substantially easier and cheaper to discover and purchase AKT as well as other tokens from a wide variety of Cosmos projects that historically have been harder to access. We're proud to be one of the first available assets on the platform.\\&quot;\\n\\nWith Gravity DEX, blockchain developers can list their tokens and avoid regulatory restrictions and excessive listing fees from centralized exchanges. This makes it substantially easier to discover and purchase tokens from a wide variety of Cosmos projects that historically have been harder to access.&nbsp;\\n\\n> \\&quot;Just as Emeris intends to revolutionize DeFi with its cross-chain capabilities, Akash Network is a real disruptor of the cloud computing market. We\u2019re proud to have such an innovative project as one of our first supported chains, and to open its AKT token to a larger audience,\\&quot; said Sane Lebrun, VP of Growth at Tendermint.\\n\\n### **What Makes Gravity DEX Unique?**\\n\\nGravity DEX has three main characteristics that differentiate it from other decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;\\n\\n1.  It leverages both an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model and an orderbook system.\\n    \\n2.  Improves price consistency through the use of an Equivalent Swap Price Model (ESPM) instead of a Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM).&nbsp;\\n    \\n3.  To remove the possibility of front-running, making trading fairer, it handles orders in batches (per block) instead of serial order.\\n    \\n\\nWith Gravity DEX, users will have access to a cross-chain decentralized exchange with lower transaction fees ($0.01 - $.10). If you\u2019ve used Uniswap, you know what a massive difference that is.&nbsp;\\n\\nTwo issues users experience when swapping on Ethereum based DEX\u2019s, like Uniswap, are unsustainably high fees and slippage which causes inconsistencies in token prices. Gravity DEX solves this problem by using the ESPM instead. ESPM lands on the latest swap price which ensures that the price users see is the price they get.&nbsp;\\n\\nGravity DEX also uses batch execution to eliminate front-running and price manipulation. Instead of sequential order execution, orders in the same block are processed simultaneously and treated equally. This eliminates the possibility of front running by paying higher gas fees.&nbsp;\\n\\n### **What\u2019s to Come?**\\n\\nSome of Gravity DEX\u2019s most exciting features including Gravity bridge and Staking Derivatives are scheduled to launch later this year.&nbsp;\\n\\nBlockchain ecosystems have historically been siloed from each other. Gravity bridge will enable cross-chain transfers between the Cosmos Hub and Ethereum, unlocking an unprecedented transfer of value between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.&nbsp;\\n\\nTypically, when you stake tokens they\u2019re locked up and can\u2019t be used for other purposes. Now with Staking derivatives, users will be able to assume long or short positions on the unearned portion of block rewards using their staked tokens.

View the full challenge description [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/create-a-keplr-wallet-guide-win-akt/804) on the Akash Community Forum.\\n\\n### **Intro**:\\n\\nWhen using cryptocurrency, one of the things you need is to set up a \u201cwallet\u201d&nbsp;in order to hold your coins and use them. A wallet is simply software or hardware that enables you to take your cryptocurrency from an exchange (where you buy crypto) and transfer it to a place where it is usable. Using your own wallet instead of storing crypto on an exchange is important because it reduces your risk of losing funds from an exchange hack, and it allows you to deploy your crypto into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications like&nbsp;[Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/)&nbsp;or stake (lock up your funds to secure the network to earn rewards) at higher rates. Exchange wallets are great for buying crypto, non-exchange wallets are better for just about everything else!\\n\\nThe Cosmos Ecosystem has a few compatible wallets, but one that is extremely easy to use is&nbsp;[Keplr](https://keplr.app/). Keplr comes pre-installed with support for Cosmos, Osmosis, Secret Network, Akash Network, Crypto.org, Starname, Sifchain, Certik, Irisnet, Regen, Persistence, Sentinel, Kava, Cyber, and Straightedge. That\u2019s a lot of options! But, in fact, you can actually add any Cosmos-based token through a few extra steps.\\n\\nThis tutorial will show you how to download Keplr on a browser extension.&nbsp;[**Here**](https://youtu.be/8lwmAOaG6LE) **is a YouTube version of this guide where I show you how to download, fund, and trade Akash with a Keplr wallet.**&nbsp;[**Here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGu3wiwcxNc&amp;t=642s)&nbsp;**is my video about how to deploy on Akash with a Keplr wallet.**\\n\\n### How to Download and Install Keplr for Google Chrome:\\n\\n1.

Cloud hosting usually comes at a higher cost and requires contracts, and service providers can charge extra fees for bandwidth usage. Making things more difficult, some cloud providers are shutting off mining operations at will. Crypto-mining projects like [PKT](https://pkt.cash/), are looking for better cloud providers and now they can run on Akash Network, the world\u2019s first open-source and decentralized cloud marketplace.\\n\\nPKT is a Bitcoin fork using PacketCrypt, a \u201cbandwidth-hard,\u201d proof-of-work blockchain that requires bandwidth and CPU to mine. Miners use idle CPU time to generate small messages called announcements and broadcast them to block miners who pay for them. PKT announcement miners and block miners collaborate to connect bandwidth from their local Internet connections and build a global, decentralized edge network. The PKT Network is designed to enable high-speed, low-cost Internet access without requiring a corporate ISP.\\n\\nAkash Network helps miners find and lease cloud-hosted CPU and bandwidth from data centers at a lower cost than traditional cloud providers. PKT miners operating on Akash spend 50% less compared to centralized cloud providers. Akash customers also reduce the risk of having operations shut down by providers. While providers ultimately decide if they want to stop bidding on a deployment, the providers on Akash Network are crypto-friendly and benefit by monetizing their underutilized hardware infrastructure on Akash\u2019s marketplace.\\n\\nPerformance is critical to miners, and the team at Chandra Station found Akash was far more performant than Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a side-by-side comparison. We asked several experienced miners from the PKT community to validate the results. After further testing by the community, we found that miners on Akash produce about 2x the amount of PKT as the AWS (c4.2xlarge) EC2 instance with 8 cores. [See our performance results and share your results on the Akash Community](https://forum.akash.network/t/pkt-performance-testing-results/).\\n\\nSupporting the PKT ecosystem is mutually beneficial to PKT and Akash. Akash\u2019s community can deploy infrastructure towards PKT\u2019s mission to decentralize access to the Internet and also profit by monetizing bandwidth resources.\\n\\n### Choosing the Ideal Configuration for PKT\\n\\nWhen choosing a configuration for PKT mining in the cloud, a higher amount of vCPU cores will yield more PKT, but this performance comes at a higher cost paid in Akash Token (AKT). Akash\u2019s CTO, Adam Bozanovich, looked at the results of the performance testing with various CPU configurations to find the ideal configuration that produces the most PKT for the least AKT spent.\\n\\nThe ideal configuration for PKT miners is 10 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 1 GB storage. Configurations with less than 10 vCPU do not yield as much PKT and consume excess RAM and storage.\\n\\nConfigurations with 1 core running on 10 miners still produce a similar amount of PKT, but the 10 core miner produced a better price to performance ratio.\\n\\n[Visit the Akash Community](https://forum.akash.network/) to find more guides, ask for help, and connect with other PKT miners. You can also join the [Akash Discord server](http://discord.akash.network/) to chat with us live.\\n\\n### Mining is as easy as 1, 2, 3\\n\\nThis article from [Chandra Station](https://www.chandrastation.com/) will walk you through how to deploy a PKT announcement miner on the Akash Network. There are three steps to a successful deployment:\\n\\n1.  Creating a PKT wallet.\\n2.  Create a configuration file, using Akash\u2019s stack definition language (SDL).\\n3.  Deploy the PKT miner on Akash.\\n\\n### Step 1: Create Your PKT Wallet\\n\\nThere are PKT wallets for Windows, macOS and command-line. Visit [pkt.cash](https://pkt.cash/wallet/) and [pkt.world](http://pkt.world/wallet) (Windows only) to try out the wallets that support mining.\\n\\n#### **Microsoft Windows**\\n\\n- Download the most recent zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip available from [pktd releases page](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/releases): (e.g. pktd-v1.3.1-windows.zip).\\n- Go to the Downloads directory.\\n- Unarchive the content of the file.\\n- Open the command prompt.\\n- Type cd Downloads to change directory to the downloads folder.\\n\\n#### **MacOS and Linux**\\n\\n- Download one of the most recent packages available for Linux or macOS from [pktd releases page](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/releases): (e.g. pktd-v1.3.1-macos.pkg).\\n- Install pktwallet and other utilities by clicking on the package icon in the Finder.\\n\\n#### **For Linux**\\n\\n- Download one of the following packages:\\n- pktd-v1.3.1-linux.deb (Debian or Ubuntu).\\n- pktd-v1.3.1-linux.rpm (Fedora or RedHat).\\n- pktd AUR package (Arch linux or Manjaro).\\n- Install pktwallet and other utilities by clicking on the appropriate package icon or running an installation command.\\n\\n#### Creating a wallet\\n\\nTo create a new PKT wallet, use the pktwallet \u2014 create command:\\n\\n**For Mac:** `pktwallet --create`\\n\\n**For Windows:** `./bin/pktwallet.exe --create`\\n\\nYou will be prompted to follow a few steps, make sure you write your seed words on paper so that you can recover your funds even if your computer is damaged.\\n\\n#### Run PKT wallet\\n\\nAfter creating your wallet, you can launch pktwallet with:\\n\\n**For Mac:** `pktwallet`\\n\\n**For Windows:** `./bin/pktwallet`\\n\\nWatch the output from the logs and when you see a log line like this:\\n\\n```sh\\n1608294386 [INF] headerlogger.go:64 Processed 1 block in the last 24.82s (height 702781, 2020-12-18 13:26:01 +0100 CET)\\n```\\n\\nCompare the height number in the log line (e.g. 702781) to the number in [the pkt block explorer](https://explorer.pkt.cash/) to see when your wallet is up to date.\\n\\nYou may leave pktwallet running in the background or start it only when needed.\\n\\n#### Creating a new PKT address\\n\\nWhile **pktwallet** is running in the background, open a new terminal window, change directory again if needed, and run the following command:\\n\\n**For Mac:** `pktctl --wallet getnewaddress`\\n\\n**For Windows:** `./bin/pktctl.exe --wallet getnewaddress`\\n\\nYou should see a series of numbers and letters beginning with pkt1, this is your address which you can use for receiving coins.\\n\\n**NOTE**: Every time you use getnewaddress, the address you receive must be remembered by **pktwallet** forever so only use it when you actually need an address.\\n\\nYou now have a PKT wallet address and we can move on to step two.\\n\\n### Step 2: Create Your Configuration File&nbsp;\\n\\nWhen deploying on Akash, miners define the deployment services, data centers, requirements, and pricing parameters, in a \u201cmanifest\u201d - a configuration file that may end in `.yml` or `.yaml`. This configuration file follows the YAML standard and is very similar to Docker Compose files. The file is written in a human-friendly language called [Stack Definition Language (SDL)](https://akash.network/docs/sdl). This SDL file is a form to request resources and declare deployment attributes.\\n\\nBelow is an example configuration file written in the Akash stack definition language (SDL). The file has four sections: version, services, profiles, deployment. Just change the wallet address in the **services** section and you are good to go, or modify it to your taste.\\n\\n[Download the file](https://github.com/ovrclk/pkt-miner/blob/main/deploy.yaml) or copy the contents below and save it to a new file named `**deploy.yml**`.\\n\\n```yml title=\\&quot;deploy.yml\\&quot;\\nversion: \\&quot;2.0\\&quot;\\nservices:\\n  miner:\\n    image: chandrastation/pkt_on_akash:v1.0.0\\n    env:\\n      - WALLET_ADDR=<PKT_Wallet>\\n      - POOL1=http://pool.pkteer.com\\n      - POOL2=http://pool.pktpool.io\\n      - POOL3=http://pool.pkt.world\\n      - POOL4=http://pool.srizbi.com\\n    expose:\\n      - port: 3000\\n        as: 80\\n        to:\\n          - global: true\\n\\nprofiles:\\n  compute:\\n    miner:\\n      resources:\\n        cpu:\\n          units: 10\\n        memory:\\n          size: 1Gi\\n        storage:\\n          size: 1Gi\\n  placement:\\n    miner:\\n      attributes:\\n        host: akash\\n      signedBy:\\n        anyOf:\\n          - \\&quot;akash1365yvmc4s7awdyj3n2sav7xfx76adc6dnmlx63\\&quot;\\n      pricing:\\n        miner:\\n          denom: uakt\\n          amount: 1000\\n\\ndeployment:\\n  miner:\\n    miner:\\n      profile: miner\\n      count: 1\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Deploy Your Miner to Akash\\n\\nIf you are new to Akash Network, you will need to install Akash and set up your wallet, and get some AKT to fund your deployments. Head over to the [Quick Start Guide](https://akash.network/docs/guides/deploy) to get started. It takes just a few minutes to install Akash, and just seconds to create a wallet and add a certificate to the Akash blockchain, enabling you to deploy to Akash.\\n\\nWe recommend using the amazing new [Akashlytics Deploy Tool](https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy) for an easy-to-use Windows or Mac OS tool to deploy. But we know you are a rockstar, and you\u2019ll probably want to use the CLI, so keep reading.\\n\\nBefore you can create a deployment, a certificate must first be created. Your certificate needs to be created only once per account and can be used across all deployments. To do this, run:\\n\\n```sh\\nakash tx cert create client --chain-id $AKASH_CHAIN_ID --keyring-backend os --from $AKASH_KEY_NAME --node $AKASH_NODE --fees 5000uakt\\n```\\n\\nIf you see an error adding your certificate to the blockchain, try again! Now to deploy on Akash, run:\\n\\n```sh\\nakash tx deployment create deploy.yml --from` `**<your_wallet_name>**` `--node https://rpc.akash.forbole.com:443 --chain-id akashnet-2 --fees 5000uakt -y\\n```\\n\\nAfter that command, a string of JSON will appear in your terminal/command prompt.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\&quot;height\\&quot;: \\&quot;1696542\\&quot;,\\n  \\&quot;txhash\\&quot;: \\&quot;AF360662F5EF02E22C2FC7CDD1975164FC04651C8B911144FB9B15F06AEFE90C\\&quot;,\\n  \\&quot;codespace\\&quot;: \\&quot;\\&quot;,\\n  \\&quot;code\\&quot;: 0,\\n  \\&quot;data\\&quot;: \\&quot;0A130A116372656174652D6465706C6F796D656E74\\&quot;,\\n  \\&quot;raw_log\\&quot;: \\&quot;[{\\\\\\&quot;events\\\\\\&quot;:[{\\\\\\&quot;type\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash.v1\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;attributes\\\\\\&quot;:[{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;module\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;deployment\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;action\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;deployment-created\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;version\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;629fe5d9f40da5a3882b3e9d0ec3ad50d31bc6491f84807987196eed2f87a549\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;owner\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;dseq\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;1696540\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;module\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;market\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;action\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;order-created\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;owner\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;dseq\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;1696540\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;gseq\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;1\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;oseq\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;1\\\\\\&quot;}]},{\\\\\\&quot;type\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;message\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;attributes\\\\\\&quot;:[{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;action\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;create-deployment\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;sender\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;sender\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;}]},{\\\\\\&quot;type\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;transfer\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;attributes\\\\\\&quot;:[{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;recipient\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash17xpfvakm2amg962yls6f84z3kell8c5lazw8j8\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;sender\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;amount\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;5000uakt\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;recipient\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash14pphss726thpwws3yc458hggufynm9x77l4l2u\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;sender\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;akash10a670qvazh3qa6xdvclc4jtrdjrnwm392x66we\\\\\\&quot;},{\\\\\\&quot;key\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;amount\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;value\\\\\\&quot;:\\\\\\&quot;5000000uakt\\\\\\&quot;}]}]}]\\&quot;,\\n  \\&quot;logs\\&quot;: [\\n    {\\n      \\&quot;msg_index\\&quot;: 0,\\n      \\&quot;log\\&quot;: \\&quot;\\&quot;,\\n      \\&quot;events\\&quot;: [\\n        {\\n          \\&quot;type\\&quot;: \\&quot;akash.v1\\&quot;,\\n          \\&quot;attributes\\&quot;: [\\n            { \\&quot;key\\&quot;: \\&quot;module\\&quot;, \\&quot;value\\&quot;: \\&quot;deployment\\&quot;

The purpose of the program is to expand the developer community, encourage collaboration between developers, and develop open-source projects to promote further adoption and usage of Akash Network\u2019s decentralized cloud.\\n\\nInspired by startup programs like AWS Activate and Y Combinator, the Developer Grant Program offers funding, guidance, support, and marketing for developers including:\\n\\n- **Grants**: Developers can apply for grants in amounts ranging from $100 to $100,000 paid in $AKT.\\n- **Office Hours**: Office hours from Akash\u2019s community and core development team to provide guidance and best practices as they build and test.\\n- **Collaboration**: Every project funded will be open source and will have its own channel on Discord to communicate with the Akash community.\\n- **Powered by Akash**: Promising projects will be featured on our forum and website to amplify attention.\\n- **Demo Days:** The top developers will present their projects to investors, advisors, and other developers in the Akash community via blogs and Akash branded livestreams.\\n\\n### Eligibility for Grants\\n\\nAll software developers and engineers with a GitHub account are eligible.\\n\\n### What can I do with $AKT tokens?\\n\\nYou can use the grants for infrastructure services provided on the Akash Network:\\n\\n- Deploy container-based apps on managed Kubernetes.\\n- Host websites on the Akash open-source cloud hosting platform.\\n- Build web apps or API backends on robust infrastructure.\\n- Apply for up to $100,000 from the Community Pool.\\n- Securely lease out your data center as a provider.\\n\\n### How do I get help with Akash?\\n\\n- **Getting Started Guides**: Our guides and tutorials are written by the community to help you get started deploying on Akash quickly. Click [here](https://forum.akash.network/c/learn/14) to get started.\\n- **Tech Support**: Technical support for all developers is free regardless of how much AKT you spend, stake, or own. Get technical support [here](https://forum.akash.network/c/support/19).\\n- **Ask us Anything**: Have a question about Akash? Join the discussion on our active community forum, [here](https://forum.akash.network/c/support/faq/24).\\n\\n### **Explore the Tiers**\\n\\nThe Developer Grant Program has a wide range of award tiers, from $100 to $100,000. The amount of funding received depends on the milestones achieved and funding tiers unlocked.\\n\\nTo start, the program has four award tiers to support all types of projects large and small.\\n\\n- **$100 Initiate Grant**: The purpose of this funding is to support a large number of developers in running their first apps on Akash. If a developer sends these tokens to an exchange, they will be ineligible for future funding, as well as the next tier of funding.\\n- **$1,000 Seed Grant**: The Seed Grant requires a developer to create a detailed proposal for their project and share this with the community for public comment and questions. Developers are expected to open source their project for the community, publish a detailed guide, and answer questions from the community.\\n- **$10,000 Incubator Grant**: The Incubator Grant is awarded only if progress is made by the developer to meet the milestones in their proposal. The developers may be asked to present their project in a recorded livestream and answer questions live from the community.\\n- **$100,000 Accelerator Grant:** The Accelerator Grant is only awarded to developers that have consistently met their milestones, demonstrated improvements, and shown a willingness to remain open source and collaborate with the Akash community.\\n\\nAll grants are paid in $AKT to the developer\u2019s Akash account address. To prevent fraudulent activity, the account is linked to the developer\u2019s accounts on Discourse, GitHub, and Discord. This award is a non-dilutive donation, and Akash\u2019s treasury and community do not gain equity in projects with the grants. The grants must be used to deploy and run applications on Akash Network.\\n\\n### **Milestones**\\n\\nMilestones for each project will be determined as part of the grant application. A milestone is a goal such as the development of a feature, the release of a working beta, and the completion of the work. A typical project should have 3-4 milestones and be completed within 2-4 months. Projects that complete their milestones will present to investors, advisors, and developers in the community on a scheduled Demo Day.\\n\\n### **What types of projects will be funded?**\\n\\nWe are committed to a transparent and clear process and we want to set expectations for the types of projects that will be considered for funding.\\n\\nProjects that apply for grants from the developer program will need to outline how their project will contribute and add value to the Akash ecosystem.\\n\\nHere are some examples of projects that we hope to see submitted:\\n\\n- Developer tooling for Akash including SDKs and APIs.\\n- Open-source developer tools (Homebrew).\\n- Creator platforms (CMS, podcasting, blogging, forums, GitLab).\\n- Decentralized web services (Handshake, DNS, OpenRegistry).\\n- Backend as a service (Hasura on Akash).\\n- Platform as a service (Heroku on Akash).\\n- Open-source communications (Chat, Email).\\n- Desktop deployment interface.\\n- Hosted deployment interface with wallet integration.\\n- App Store interface (OpenChannel on Akash).\\n- Persistent storage integrations (Sia, Skynet, Filebase, Arweave, Filecoin, Storj, Coldstack).\\n\\n### **How will the projects be chosen?**\\n\\nProposals will be reviewed by the [Community Awards Board (CAB)](https://forum.akash.network/t/proposal-developer-grants-program-community-awards-board/541).\\n\\nEach month the board will meet to review the proposals submitted by developers and craft on-chain proposals for the community to vote on. Meetings will be publicly announced and hosted online via Google Meet or Zoom. All meetings will be recorded and minutes will be shared publicly with the community.\\n\\nThe CAB is open to Akash customers, validators, providers, investors, advisors, employees, and former employees. If you\u2019d like to nominate someone, please post your nomination publicly on the community forum\u2019s Grant Applications.\\n\\nBeing a member of this board requires active participation to review developer applications and be involved in the decision-making and proposal writing process. Initially, voting requires attendance.\\n\\n### **Referral Rewards**\\n\\nOne of the main goals of the Developer Grant Program is to attract talented developers from across the globe. If you would like to invite a developer to the Akash developer program, [create an invitation](https://forum.akash.network/my/invited/) and share it with your social network. Each month, the community members with the most successful invitations will be awarded $100 or $1,000 in grants.\\n\\n### **Incubators, accelerators, and VCs, oh my!**\\n\\nAkash will be partnering with other startup funds to provide free hosting on Akash. If you are a venture capital firm, accelerator, incubator, or other startup-enabling organization interested in providing Akash developer grants to your startups, contact [partners@akash.network](mailto:partners@akash.network).\\n\\n### **How will this be funded?**\\n\\nIn order to scale the program quickly, the initial grants will be awarded by the Akash Treasury.\\n\\nWe are currently funding developers through five [coding challenges](https://forum.akash.network/c/challenge/7). In the last 3 months, the Akash Treasury has awarded over 80 developers over 7,000 $AKT. Seven developers were [winners of the Solana hackathon](https://forum.akash.network/t/winners-of-the-akash-solana-hackathon/455), and as part of the Sovrython hackathon, [37 developers](https://forum.akash.network/c/hackathons/sovryn/16) received $100 of $AKT.\\n\\nGrants over $1,000 will be proposed by the CAB to tap into the Community Pool. The CAB will work with developers to create proposals to fund projects and encourage voting by the community.\\n\\nAs of this article, the community pool is over one million tokens at 1,008,789 $AKT. The CAB may propose to award these grants directly to developers to reduce complexity or propose to award a grant to multi-signature wallets, managed by community members.\\n\\n### **How to Apply for Developer Grants**\\n\\nThe process is simple.

Sovrython was a 6-week long hackathon that invited developers from all chains to collaborate on decentralization/privacy, data science, integrations, and finance with a shared goal to accelerate the future of DeFi.\\n\\nWith over $500,000 in awards and grants, this event is the highest value DeFi Hackathon bounty program ever offered on Gitcoin. The event was produced by Sovryn\u2019s [exiledsurfer](https://gitcoin.co/exiledsurfer) and hosted on [Gitcoin](http://gitcoin.co), the platform where developers get paid to work on open-source software.\\n\\nAkash committed $100,000 in $AKT to the winners of our three challenges including:\\n\\n1.  Securely deploy the Sovryn node using Akash Network\\n2.  Design an easy-to-use UI to help developers deploy any app on Akash\\n3.  Build an app that leverages decentralized storage such as Skynet and run it on Akash\\n\\n**You can find all of the submissions with demo videos on the** [**Akash Community**](https://forum.akash.network/t/everyone-s-a-winner-in-the-sovrynthon-hackathon/)**.**\\n\\n## Sovryn Node Challenge:\\n\\nThe challenge was to securely deploy a Sovryn node on the Akash Mainnet and submit a detailed guide on how it works.\\n\\n## 1st Place: [End to End Automated Node](https://github.com/lebeau-remy/Sovryn-Node) by EoM Games\\n\\nBefore the hackathon, [EoM Games](https://github.com/lebeau-remy/Sovryn-Node) had already completed the challenge and published a YouTube video walking through how to run a Sovryn node on Akash.&nbsp;\u200b\u200bThe Sovryn Nodes on Akash now automatically deploy on Akash using Github Actions. These GitHub actions can be used to automate the deployment of any app from a simple GitHub push to a production app running on the Akash Network.\\n\\n**\u201cThe Sovryn Node being deployed on Akash demonstrates some tooling I\u2019ve built while slightly extending the use of Akash\u2019s own end to end testing. With some secrets from Akash\u2019s GitHub repo it can automatically tear down and stand up giving rise to a complete CI/CD platform anyone can use,\\&quot; said EoM Games.**\\n\\nIf you have [Metamask](http://metamask.io) installed on your Tor browser, browsing to [https://sovryntor.eth](https://sovryntor.eth) will resolve the onion address and website. If you don\u2019t have this setup, you can see the Akash hosted URL by [clicking here.](http://ce3ueoed7lbr3fak3igb8hc170.ingress.sjc1p0.mainnet.akashian.io/)\\n\\n## 2nd Place: Vault Security by Rustam Abdullin\\n\\nThere is no doubt that a lot of time and effort was put into [Rustam Abdullin](https://github.com/rustamabdullin/sovryn-node-123)\u2019s submission. Just take a look at his very detailed guide, [here](https://forum.akash.network/t/akash-sovryn-node-deployment-guideline-telegram-rsk-wallet-secrets-management-rstm/386/9). This project aims to protect the private key using the HashiCorp Vault. The private key can be gathered using the one-time token that can be unwrapped using short TTL wrapping token only. Even the user or the system that created the initial token won't see the original value. The original Sovryn Node repository keeps the private key (or private key password) in a clear text format.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627919884-sovryn-vault-interaction-diagram-v01.png)\\n\\n\u201cThe idea is to completely avoid storing private keys and their password in a cleartext format,\u201d said Rustam Abdullin, Hackathon Winner.\\n\\nRustam\u2019s node is still running today, [click here to view the front-end](http://ce3ueoed7lbr3fak3igb8hc170.ingress.sjc1p0.mainnet.akashian.io/), and the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rus7am/sovryn-node-vault03) is ready for someone else to deploy.&nbsp; [See the demo, here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQVzrhOT5Yc)\\n\\n## 3rd Place: Container Security by Sara Robertson&nbsp;\\n\\n[Sara Robertson](https://github.com/sarasioux/akash-sovryn-node) tackled the security challenge of running a Sovryn node on Akash by getting the private keys and wallet configuration onto the containerized image without compromising security. Sara took an elegant approach and rather than use a key manager, this project uses a disposable or ephemeral container that you can recreate at any time, and the keys are ephemeral in the environment.\\n\\n## 4th Place: Sovryn Node by Tanishq Dsharma\\n\\n[Tanishq Dsharma](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/SovrynNode-on-Akash) completed the challenge and deployed a Sovryn node on Akash and wrote a very detailed guide with step-by-step instructions for developers to follow. His node is still up and running and you can check it out, [here](http://io375ka6dldvb3drt7do4s1q78.ingress.sjc1p0.mainnet.akashian.io/). At the same time, he submitted for the Open Cloud Challenge!\\n\\n# Open Cloud Challenge:\\n\\nThe challenge was to build an open-source app on the Akash Mainnet that leverages decentralized storage such as Skynet or Sia.\\n\\n## 1st Place: [OpenRegistry.dev](http://openregistry.dev) by Jasdeep Singh\\n\\nJasdeep Singh and his partner Guacamole launched [OpenRegistry](https://github.com/jay-dee7/OpenRegistry) a decentralized container registry, which would be fully OCI Distribution Specification compliant. This means that OpenRegistry would be completely compatible with any relatively new version of container engines like Docker, Containerd, Podman, etc.\\n\\n**\u201cOpenRegistry uses Akash Network as its compute layer and SkyNet for storage. Since Akash Network provides a marketplace for compute, the fault tolerance, scalability, and resiliency were our priorities from day one.\u201d Jasdeep Sing, OpenRegistry founder.**\\n\\nWorking with OpenRegistry is no different than working with any other container registry. Head over to [Parachute by OpenRegistry](https://parachute.openregistry.dev/) and sign yourself up for the beta.\\n\\n## 2nd Place: [FanNFT](https://github.com/script-money/FanNFT) by ScriptMoney\\n\\n[ScriptMoney](https://github.com/script-money/FanNFT) built a decentralized App that allows an influencer - Key Opinion Leader (KOL) - to easily give NFTs to their fans.&nbsp;ScriptMoney explains the use case, **\u201cKOL can set up promotional content and create NFT gift packs. Fans will have a chance to win an NFT drop by simply tapping retweet to my Twitter. The server will automatically crawl the tweets, randomly select the lucky winners and generate NFT gifts to send to them.\u201d**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627898785-overview.png)\\n\\nHosted on [Akash](https://akash.network/), using [flow blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/) smart contracts, each NFT image is saved on [Skynet](https://siasky.net/). The FanNFT application has an automatic schedule runner that needs to be deployed using Akash's unique server-side container capability instead of renting a traditional cloud server. To store the NFT, one solution is to convert to base64 and store it directly into the contract.. The disadvantage is that on-chain storage is expensive, and each request will get the full data, and the client cannot use the cache which causes slow loading. Instead, the FanNFT has a component to upload a file to be stored in Skynet\u2019s decentralized storage and returns a Skylink to the file.\\n\\n## 3rd Place: [Email Analyzer](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/EmailAnalyzer-Akash-CLoud) by Tanishq Dsharma\\n\\n[Tanishq](https://github.com/TanishqDsharma/EmailAnalyzer-Akash-CLoud) built an email forensics dApp that will allow the user to inspect email headers to verify that the email was from a trusted source and not from an attacker/malicious user. This app analyzes your email data on the basis of email headers which helps to determine if the user that sent the email is genuine or fake.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627897702-screen-shot-2021-08-02-at-2-47-51-am.png)\\n\\nThe Home page of the application will have a text area field where the user will paste his/her email data, the user clicks submit, and the email is analyzed. The app will analyze all the security-related email headers and display them in the response.\\n\\n## 4th Place: dApps by Piyush\\n\\nLast but not least, [Piyush](https://github.com/Developer-piyush/AKASHCLOUD) built a set of dApps and apps to demonstrate correct usage of Ethereum apps, specifically, the EthJS module. Many of these examples simulate an Ethereum node running in the browser.\\n\\n**\u201cIt feels so good to visit the Akash forum every day and see new amazing projects and their implementation.\u201d - Piyush**\\n\\n# Deploy UI Challenge:&nbsp;\\n\\nThe challenge was to build a UI to allow app developers to quickly deploy an open-source application on the Akash Mainnet. Submit a detailed guide on how to use the UI and how it works.\\n\\n## 1st Place: [Akashlytics Deploy](https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy)\\n\\n[Akashlytics Deploy](https://github.com/Akashlytics/akashlytics-deploy) can create or import a wallet, fund the wallet, create a certificate, create a deployment, accept a bid to create a lease and finally, send the manifest. The process of creating and hosting a web app on Akash inspired the [Akashlytics](https://www.akashlytics.com) team to create a fully dependency-free desktop app that can be installed in a few clicks on Windows, Mac, and Linux and be able to do all the steps required to deploy on Akash in the same app.\\n\\n**\u201cThe main goals were to make it easy to use, secure, and accessible across all platforms.\u201d Akashlytics founder Maxime Beachamp**\\n\\nFor the first beta version running on Windows, Akashlytics had to build custom wallet interfaces for transactions and ported some of the Akash CLI code written in Go to JavaScript to support all the operations. Since this is a desktop app, the user is in complete control of its certificate and most importantly, its private key or mnemonic. The latest version of the tool can be downloaded from the Akashlytics website, [https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy](https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy)\\n\\n## 2nd Place: [Akash Deploy UI](https://github.com/spacepotahto/akash-deploy-ui) by SpacePotato\\n\\nThe [Akash Deploy Website](https://github.com/spacepotahto/akash-deploy-ui) interacts with the [Keplr wallet](https://keplr.xyz/) browser extension to allow visitors to quickly deploy to Akash using a hosted deploy website.&nbsp; The Deploy Website leverages a new [AkashJS](https://github.com/spacepotahto/akashjs) library that replaces the command line functionality with JavaScript. [Click here to see the live website](https://2g0cl9g6u0mn6vrbiajv5p9h508vbfq07j6fm060dl8lci85k436jh0.siasky.net/).\\n\\n**\u201cA deploy UI can lessen the learning curve and reduce friction. In my opinion, the ideal UI should be in the form of a website with Keplr wallet integration. There should be no setup or installation. One should just be able to visit the website with some AKT in their Keplr wallet, and click a couple of buttons to deploy.\u201d SpacePotato says.**\\n\\n## 3rd Place: [Harbinger](https://github.com/Grubbly/Harbinger) by Grubbly\\n\\n[Harbinger](https://github.com/Grubbly/Harbinger) is a cross-platform deployment manager for the Akash Network. It directly interfaces with the Akash CLI via a REST API hosted locally on your system, which by nature grants you absolute control over your keys, deployments, and data. [Click here to read the guide.](https://github.com/Grubbly/Harbinger/blob/main/docs/hackathon.md)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627896268-earlyfrontend.gif)\\n\\nNothing is ever stored on a central server and you own your data. [Harbinger](https://github.com/Grubbly/Harbinger) is completely open-source, transparent, and uses whatever version of Akash CLI that is installed on your system path to execute commands. This approach allows users to audit both Harbinger and Akash code bases to ensure nothing fishy is going on and commands are doing what they say they are doing.\\n\\n## 4th Place: VSCode Extension by Waylad\\n\\n[Waylad](https://github.com/waylad/akash-vscode-extension) built an integration for one of the most popular IDE\u2019s VSCode. The result is a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/waylad/akash-vscode-extension) that makes Akash deployments _**directly**_ from VSCode. To install, go to your VSCode extensions and click the three dots in the top right corner, then `Install from VSIX` and choose the `akash.vsix` from this repository. VSCode is one of the most popular IDEs and this project could become one of the most impactful efforts in the hackathon.\\n\\n## 5th Place: MyEtherWallet by SpecterofNet\\n\\nSpecterofNet deployed the [MyEtherWallet](https://specterofnet.medium.com/how-to-deploy-online-wallet-on-a-8bbdbc86b774) on Akash. While this doesn\u2019t meet the requirements of our challenge, we encourage all developers to get involved in Akash. The new Developer Grant Program will offer $100 for developers who can deploy on Akash. [Learn how to apply](https://forum.akash.network/c/grants/) on the [Akash's Community.](http://forum.akash.network/)\\n\\n# Watch the Livestream as we announce the winners\\n\\nJoin me on the Sovrython Results Livestream today, Monday August 2nd at 1PM PST / 8PM UTC hosted by Sovryn\u2019s @EdanYago and @exiledsurfer live on the Sovrython website [sovrython.sovryn.app](http://sovrython.sovryn.app/) or on YouTube.

Filebase is the world\u2019s first object-based storage platform to deliver multi-cloud and dWeb storage options for developers and enterprises.\\n\\nDecentralized storage networks take advantage of smart, yet complex software which needs to be constantly fed to ensure that storage contracts have enough cryptocurrency. Filebase abstracts away all of that process, making things painless for the end-user.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re using the traditional cloud today, their dashboard should look very familiar to you:\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627339911-image.png)\\n\\nTogether with Filebase and Akash, developers and enterprises can now quickly migrate from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, onto a decentralized network of cloud providers at a reduced cost of up to 85%. By offering open-source dWeb compute and petabyte-scale object storage, developers and enterprises will now have the ability to pair dWeb applications with thousands of existing backup tools, application SDKs, and frameworks that they already know and love.\\n\\n\u201cThe Filebase API is S3 compatible, which allows developers to seamlessly leverage multiple decentralized storage networks for the first time,\u201d said Joshua Noble, CEO and Co-founder of Filebase. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to pair our S3 compatible access layer to decentralized storage networks, with the power and flexibility of Akash Network. We can\u2019t wait to see what our ecosystem builds through the pairing of dWeb compute and multi-cloud storage as one.\u201d\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re highlighting several open-source projects featuring this integration:\\n\\n- [Akash documentation site](https://akash.network/docs/)\\n\\n- [Pinterest app on Rails](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails)\\n\\n- [Backup and restore Postgres](https://akash.network/docs/guides/postgres-sql-restore-or-backup/)\\n\\n- [Unstoppable Web 2.0](https://akash.network/docs/guides/unstopabble-web/)\\n\\n- [Hosted Helium Validators](https://github.com/filebase/helium-on-akash)\\n\\n- [Hosted Cosmos Nodes](https://github.com/ovrclk/cosmos-omnibus)\\n\\n**Things Are Getting Pinteresting**\\n\\nThe first integration with Filebase was launched months before this partnership. The [Pinterest app on Rails](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails) can be seen live on [pin.akash.host](http://pin.akash.host) and features adorable and adoptable animals in a pinterest like view. The web app streams images from decentralized storage using Filebase\u2019s S3 Compatible API. Backups are also stored using the same API.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627339962-image-1.png)\\n\\nThrough this integration with Filebase, apps running on Akash can now backup, restore, and migrate a database by connecting the containers running on Akash to persistent storage on Sia, Skynet, or Storj.\\n\\n**An Easy Onramp: Flowing Data onto the Decentralized Web**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627340002-image-2.png)\\n\\n\u201cDecentralized, blockchain-based infrastructure services are quickly establishing themselves as foundational elements for the potential next generation of cloud IaaS,\\&quot; said Andrew Smith, Research Manager, Cloud Infrastructure Services at IDC. \\&quot;These services bring differentiated technology to market which is applicable to real-world use cases like storage and compute cost reduction, data compliance, backup, archive, and long-term cold storage. The partnership between Filebase and Akash highlights the continued evolution and improvements to this emerging market segment.\\&quot;\\n\\n**How To Use Filebase with Akash**\\n\\nThis is a short setup guide that will help you to quickly configure and setup both Akash and Filebase for success.\\n\\nIf you need more information about how to use Filebase, review their [Dashboard Overview](https://filebase.com/blog/introducing-the-new-and-improved-filebase-dashboard/), [Documentation Section - https://docs.filebase.com](https://docs.filebase.com), or email the team at hello@filebase.com\\n\\n## **Setup Filebase**\\n\\n- Step 1: Register for a [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) account (Promo code: **AKASH**).\\n\\n- Step 2: Login and navigate to your Buckets page.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627340058-image-3.png)\\n\\n- Step 3: Create and name your bucket, select the dWeb network of your choice.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627340093-image-4.png)\\n\\n- Step 4: Navigate to \u201cAccess Keys\u201d and copy your **API Endpoint** \u201c[https://s3.filebase.com](https://s3.filebase.com)\u201d, **Access Key** and **Secret Key** - We will use them next with Akash.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1627340152-image-5.png)\\n\\n**Setup Akash**\\n\\n- Step 1: Set the environment variables in the [deploy.yml](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-postgres-restore/blob/master/deploy.yml) and deploy on Akash\\n\\n- Step 2: use the URL and port Akash gives you to connect to the Postgres server, with the credentials you provided in the environment variables. For example `cluster.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io:31234`\\n\\n### **Using with an App Container**\\n\\nAlternatively, you can add your own app container to the deploy.yml and expose the Postgres 5432 port to your application only for a local server.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n`services:`\\n\\n`app:`\\n\\n`image: myappimage:v1`\\n\\n`depends_on:`\\n\\n`- service: postgres`\\n\\n`cron:`\\n\\n`image: ghcr.io/ovrclk/akash-postgres-restore:v0.0.4`\\n\\n`env:`\\n\\n`- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password`\\n\\n`...`\\n\\n`depends_on:`\\n\\n`- service: postgres`\\n\\n`postgres:`\\n\\n`image: postgres:12.6`\\n\\n`env:`\\n\\n`- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password`\\n\\n`expose:`\\n\\n`- port: 5432`\\n\\n`to:`\\n\\n`- service: app`\\n\\n`- service: cron`\\n\\n### **Environment variables**\\n\\n- `POSTGRES_USER=postgres` - your Postgres server username\\n\\n- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password` - your Postgres server password\\n\\n- `POSTGRES_HOST=postgres` - Postgres server host (this will be whatever you named it in deploy.yml)\\n\\n- `POSTGRES_PORT=5432` - Postgres port, will be 5432 unless you aliased it in deploy.yml\\n\\n- `POSTGRES_DATABASE=akash_postgres` - name of your database\\n\\n- `BACKUP_PATH=bucketname/path` - bucket and path for your deployments (make sure directories exist first)\\n\\n- `BACKUP_KEY=key` - your Filebase access key\\n\\n- `BACKUP_SECRET=secret` - your Filebase secret\\n\\n- `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE=secret` - a passphrase to encrypt your backups with\\n\\n- `BACKUP_HOST=https://s3.filebase.com` - the S3 backup host, this defaults to Filebase but can be any S3 compatible host\\n\\n- `BACKUP_SCHEDULE=*/15 * * * *` - the cron schedule for backups (defaults to every 15 minutes)\\n\\n- `BACKUP_RETAIN=7 days` - how many days to keep backups for\\n\\n## **Local Development**\\n\\nYou can run the application locally using Docker compose.\\n\\nCopy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and populate\\n\\nRun docker-compose up to build and run the application\\n\\n## **Get Started for Free**\\n\\n[Click here to receive $100 in Akash tokens and 1 TB of S3 Compatible Object Storage for one month.](https://filebase.com/akash)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash and Filebase Replace S3 with Multi-Cloud dWeb Providers&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;A core goal of the decentralized web, also known as dWeb, is to help people and organizations regain control of their computing and storage.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;],[0,&quot;News&quot;],[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Colin Pollen&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.C26AjKLp.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,2000],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1125],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-and-filebase-replace-s3-with-multi-cloud-dweb-providers/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;from-git-to-skynet-how-to-host-large-files-on-sia/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;from-git-to-skynet-how-to-host-large-files-on-sia&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;At Akash Network, we are always looking for amazing ways to use our network adjacent to technologies that align with our mission and vision of a true and complete decentralized web.&nbsp;\\n\\nOne service that pairs well with our network is Skynet. Built on the Sia block technology stack, Skynet enables fluid and easy file serving through portals which allow users to easily upload and share media without needing to interact with the blockchain.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe real beauty of Sia is the heavy investment in a JavaScript SDK.&nbsp;\\n\\nI thought about what kinds of use cases in which we could use this SDK at Akash Network. One of the primary uses floating around today is Git Large File Support or Git LFS. Natively, you can find this service on GitHub and you can find integrations using AWS S3 buckets but I couldn\u2019t find one with Skynet integration.\\n\\n### **The Importance of Using Git**\\n\\nUsing Git to store code and large files has a lot of advantages. In scientific communities, storing references to large datasets and offloading those data sets can be both cost effective and a necessity. Creatives might want source control for binaries but want better tracking and checkout like subversion.\\n\\nFor Akash, we\u2019re continuing our focus on reducing deployment barriers and increasing developer efficiency while maintaining our value for open-source software. We want to use this integration to continue to move deployment tooling in-line and beyond our Web 2.0 counterparts.\\n\\nCurrently, there are a few LFS server implementations. The version 1 specification of Git LFS has been around for almost five years. While you still need to download and enable the LFS extension, the base Git client now ships with support during some of its main actions such as automatically pulling in binaries from the LFS server.\\n\\n### **Configuring Git LFS**\\n\\nConfiguring Git LFS is pretty straightforward. Download and install the latest version from [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Once you completed the install step use the command below:\\n\\n`git lfs install`\\n\\n### **Tracking png Files**\\n\\nNext, let\u2019s add tracking for the binary files that you want to send to Skynet. Luckily, there is an easy command to include files in tracking:\\n\\n`git lfs track \\&quot;*.png\\&quot;`\\n\\nThe previous command will start tracking any \u2018png\u2019 files in the project, these will be swapped out for text versions that contain tracking hashes.\\n\\nNow, anytime we commit and push the binary versions of the files, they will be uploaded to the LFS endpoint on our Git server. To accomplish zero config, the LFS client assumes your LFS server is attached to your Git repository host, which isn\u2019t the case in our guide today.\\n\\n### **Redirecting the LFS Client**\\n\\nTo redirect the LFS client, we simply need to add a dot file to our project. This file is appropriately named `.lfsconfig.`\\n\\n`[lfs]`\\n\\n`url = \\&quot;http://localhost:3000/akashnetwork/testFile\\&quot;`\\n\\nWe\u2019ll point our Git client to our local LFS server that\u2019s going to send our files to Skynet.&nbsp;\\n\\n### **Starting your LFS Server**\\n\\nOur next step is to start that LFS server. Akash has done the leg work of creating an out of the box server built upon the \u2018Fastify\u2019 server by Nearform. Now, the extensible server is ready to upload to Skynet.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo use this server, you\u2019ll need [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and a local version of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed to track uploads for the LFS server. First, head over to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to install a local version of the database server - there is no configuration needed here.\\n\\nTo start the server you can simply use `npx` to automatically download and execute the server for use.\\n\\n`npx @akashnetwork/lfs`\\n\\nYou should see output on the terminal indicating the server is up and running and ready to accept inbound connections.\\n\\n### **You\u2019re Almost There!**&nbsp;\\n\\nNow you\u2019re ready to add and push tracked files to the sky.\\n\\n`git add file.png`\\n\\n`git commit -m \\&quot;Add cool image\\&quot;`\\n\\n`git push origin main`\\n\\nWhile working locally, Git will keep your binary files in the working directory. When pushed, resource ids are sent to the remote repository and upon cloning the binaries, will be ushered back into the Git repository.\\n\\nYou can see a demo of the working implementation on our YouTube channel [here](https://youtu.be/W2pVpefAtA8), or try it for yourself! We\u2019re excited to keep developing tools to rapidly accelerate decentralized use and adoption.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;From Git to Skynet: How to Host Large Files on Sia&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;At Akash Network, we are always looking for amazing ways to use our network adjacent to technologies that align with our mission and vision of a true and complete decentralized web.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Developers&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Derek Anderson&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.iir4ZWqD.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,2000],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1125],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/from-git-to-skynet-how-to-host-large-files-on-sia/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-create-an-x509-certificate-in-browser-for-fun-and-profit/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-create-an-x509-certificate-in-browser-for-fun-and-profit&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;From start to finish, this guide will show you how to create a valid x509 certificate at Akash Network, with ECDSA SHA-256 in Browser.&nbsp;\\n\\nIf that statement alone sounds harrowing, it\u2019s likely because this is the kind of stuff we generally don\u2019t deal with as web developers. However, as front-end development quickly grows into full-stack app development, there are many areas we\u2019ve not traditionally encountered that have been left to our back-end brethren.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe key requirements of this task are to generate a key pair for signing and verification: Export the Private Key, Public Key, and Certificate in PEM format, so that they can be stored, or transported.\\n\\nWith Akash Network, we store the Certificate and the Public Key on-chain, so that others may verify an actor is connected to the funding source they claim to be a user of. We convert these PEM formats into uInt8 arrays to transport over protobuf.\\n\\nWhen researching, I thought this would be a simple Internet search. However, a combination of missing and outdated information made it hard to find the information needed to get current algorithms to match the spec of the other client/server with which I wanted to communicate.\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with the easy stuff first.\\n\\n### **Generating a Key Pair**\\n\\nThe most common case in which we do this today is either to validate our machine\u2019s identity in place of a password, like Github, AWS Console, CryptoCoins, or Web Servers. Now, we\u2019re going to generate one in the browser.\\n\\nLuckily life is good, and Chrome and other browser vendors have a good start at implementing Cryptography libraries in the browser. We also have some good standardization libraries for dealing with Cryptography in multiple places. Two libraries we will lean on will be [pkijs](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/PKI.js) and [asn1js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asn1js).\\n\\nEach of these libraries provides us with the needed methods/classes and types to deal with multiple aspects of a task. We can simply install these using your favorite package manager. These bundle well for modern web browsers. I\u2019m also reaching for pvutils to simplify some of its utility used for encoding the certificates into text formats. This library isn\u2019t needed in the whole cryptography portion, so feel free to swap the methods borrowed for your own preferred versions.\\n\\n    npm i pkijs asn1js pvutils\\n\\nOnce the utilities are installed let\u2019s get down to business by generating our first key pair!\\n\\n    const { \\n        getCrypto, \\n        getAlgorithmParameters \\n    } = require(\\&quot;pkijs/build\\&quot;);\\n\\nWe will use the getCrypto method here to give us a Cryptographic handler. In the browser, this generally maps to a window. SubtleCrypto could also infer to be window.crypto.webKitSubtle, window.crypto.subtle. The idea is that you will get the point of how JavaScript is standardized across the browser landscape. So we\u2019ll use getCrypto to simplify.\\n\\nWe also need to grab getAlgorithmParameters, so that we can easily get the digest information around the specific encoding and decoding that needs to be done. This greatly simplifies our need to pull together information related to all the curves, hashing math, and more needed to make this work. Thankfully, you should have access to modern and current algorithms if you keep current with pkijs. This is where I\u2019ll dispense a little advice, to stay away from prebuilt and browser bundles outside of a module ecosystem. You\u2019ll find the possibility of them being outdated in a few years if you need to move forward with your cryptography.\\n\\nBelow is the stub of code that will generate a cryptographic keypair. Here, I am going to specify an ECDSA signature using SHA-256 hashing. You may need to change these based on your target environment.\\n\\n    const crypto = getWebCrypto();\\n    const algo = getAlgorithmParameters(\\&quot;ECDSA\\&quot;, \\&quot;generatekey\\&quot;);\\n    const keyPair = crypto.generateKey(algorithm.algorithm, true, algorithm.usages);\\n\\nThat\u2019s it, you just generated a valid keypair!&nbsp;\\n\\n### **Generating Backups**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe breakdown of the generateKey method, is algo, allowExport, and usage. Two of these are already defined thanks to the getAlgorithm method, and we\u2019re free to determine if we want this keypair to be captured in code. In this case, we do, because we\u2019re going to generate backups of these, we also need to use these keys to sign and generate a valid x509 certificate.\\n\\nGenerating the x509 is much simpler than I anticipated. The biggest hurdle was understanding the way in which OIDs are applied to certificate creation. Object IDs are used to identify fields and which kind of properties should be encoded into the certificate.\\n\\nUsing an OID repository like [OID Info](http://www.oid-info.com), you can find the OIDs for the fields you\u2019ll need. There are a few common ones, like Organization, Country, and State that you can encode as well. The necessity for these fields are strictly determined by the consuming entity of the certificate. They are not needed to produce a valid certificate that can be used to verify and sign.\\n\\nTo generate the x509 we\u2019ll grab a few more helpers from pkijs. We will also get types from asn1js, so we\u2019ll bring that along for the ride as well.\\n\\n    const {\\n        AttributeTypeAndValue,\\n        Certificate,\\n        BasicConstraints,\\n        Extension,\\n        ExtKeyUsage\\n    } = require(\\&quot;pkijs/build\\&quot;);\\n    const asn1js = require(\\&quot;asn1js\\&quot;);\\n\\nThe certificate class will be used to create the x509, and the other classes will be used to decorate and interact with the certificate. You may not need ExtKeyUsage, but we will go over it since the scenario fits into other places as well.\\n\\n### **Creating a Certificate**&nbsp;\\n\\nCreating the actual certificate is super simple.\\n\\n    const cert = new Certificate();\\n\\nNow that we have a certificate in memory, we can get down to business and start to construct the needed fields of the certificate.\\n\\n    cert.version = 2;\\n    cert.serialNumber = new asn1js.Integer({ value: Date.now() });\\n\\nAgain, any of these fields are optional. We can skip right down to signing the certificate which would make it completely valid for use, but the system you are interacting with may require additional fields and descriptions -- version and serialNumber are two that are very common.\\n\\nThey are otherwise boring fields but can be used by a validator to determine if the issuer of the certificate has changed it in any meaningful way. The version is 0 offset, and the serial number here is simply the issuing timestamp. This may need to be more aggressive depending on the use case (JWT replacement for example).\\n\\n### **Exporting Private and Public Keys**&nbsp;\\n\\nTo export the private key and public key, we are going to use two standards. The pkcs#8 standard, which means Public Key Cryptography Standards. The tl;dr of this is the base64 encoded versions of our key information. Combined with headers and footers as borders, with line breaks every 64bytes.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll also use spki standard, which means we want our public key in a format easily exchangeable outside of the certificate. The purpose of spki is so that it allows for key validation outside of the certificate issuer.\\n\\nGetting these two in binary from the browser is simple with just a couple of lines of code.\\n\\n    const spki = await crypto.exportKey(\\&quot;spki\\&quot;, keyPair.privateKey);\\n    const pkcs8 = await crypto.exportKey(\\&quot;pkcs8\\&quot;, keyPair.privateKey);\\n\\n### **Structuring Binary Outputs Into Text Form**\\n\\nNow we need to structure these binary outputs into a text form with what we call boundaries. A boundary in this case is a text demarcation with a new line as seen below.\\n\\n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\\\n\\n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\\n\\nBetween these two boundaries, we are going to put a base64 representation of our certificates and keys. Remember pvutils? It is time to reach for those helpers!\\n\\n    const { arrayBufferToString, toBase64 } = require(\\&quot;pvutils\\&quot;);\\n\\nWe\u2019ll also need to format the PEM files at the 64 byte line limit. This is really easy to do with a replacement regex.\\n\\n    function formatPEM(pemString: any) {\\n       return pemString.replace(/(.{64})/g, \\&quot;$1\\\\n\\&quot;);\\n    }\\n\\n### **The Home Stretch**\\n\\nLet\u2019s use these three helper methods together to convert the ArrayBuffers to Strings then we can Base64 encode those and format them for creating our PEM files!\\n\\n    const pems = {\\n    csr: `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\\\n${formatPEM(\\n toBase64(arrayBufferToString(certBER))\\n )}\\\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----`,\\n    privateKey: `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\\\n${formatPEM(\\n       toBase64(arrayBufferToString(pkcs8))\\n    )}\\\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`,\\n    publicKey: `-----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY-----\\\\n${formatPEM(\\n toBase64(arrayBufferToString(spki))\\n )}\\\\n-----END EC PUBLIC KEY-----`,\\n    };\\n\\nThis bit of code uses the template literal to combine the boundaries in String format with the returned base64 encoding. What is left is an object that has 3 different PEM formatted files, these can be saved to memory or written to files for transportation.&nbsp;\\n\\nHappy signing!\\n\\nWant to make this a bit easier or maybe looking for a way to generate certificates that are compatible with the Akash Network?

The Omnibus package includes all of the Docker images configuration to make deploying onto [Akash Network](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash) easy and standardized for any Cosmos SDK-based blockchain.\\n\\nAll blockchains share a common architecture, the software that they develop has no centralized hardware. Blockchains have many connected nodes running software hosted across many machines. A blockchain is only considered decentralized if the hardware hosting the nodes is spread out across many locations, running in independently owned data centers or on home computers. Blockchains require decentralization for security, in order to prevent an individual or small group from taking control of the network.\\n\\nMany blockchains have a major problem today, the hardware that they use to host their blockchain is owned by one or two companies, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The world\u2019s largest companies are the owners and operators of many decentralized networks. Typically node operators will choose convenience over security, but now it\u2019s more convenient to use the Cosmos Omnibus.\\n\\n# Run Your Own Node with Cosmos Omnibus on Akash Network\\n\\nWhen setting up a validator there are countless ways to configure your setup. The Cosmos Omnibus provides examples for some of the most common configurations. The Cosmos Omnibus software package includes Docker images for [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos-cosmos-sdk)\\\\-based blockchains that are pre-configured to run on [Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash). Configuration is achieved using environment variables, with shortcuts available for common setups. Every aspect of the node configuration can be achieved in this way.\\n\\n### **Supported Networks**\\n\\nThe networks supported by the Cosmos Omnibus include Akash Network, Sentinel VPN, Gaia, Kava, Osmosis, and Persistence One. The Omnibus package includes the docker images and full configuration to run the nodes. The available docker images below can be found on the [cosmos-omnibus repository](https://github.com/ovrclk/cosmos-omnibus/pkgs/container/cosmos-omnibus). The full configuration for each of the supported chains can be found in the example deployment files linked below for each project.\\n\\n### Run your node locally\\n\\nTo test each image, you can run your blockchain node locally using the docker-compose.yml example file. To run these files, first make sure Docker is installed on your machine and run this command in the directory: docker-compose up\\n\\n### Run your node on Akash Network\\n\\nWhen you want to run your node on a cloud provider, you can easily deploy using Akash and the deploy.yml example deployment file in each chain directory which details the minimum configuration required. Follow the [Akash deployment guide](https://akash.network/docs/guides/deploy). You can use the below configuration options to add functionality.\\n\\n## **Set your Environment Configuration**&nbsp;\\n\\nCosmos blockchains can be configured entirely using environment variables instead of the config files.The chain configuration can be sourced from a JSON file as implemented by [@sikkatech](https://github.com/sikkatech/tm-networks), or from a metadata repository such as [Akash's network configuration files](https://github.com/ovrclk/net).\\n\\n**Important Note:** Every chain has its own prefix, but the format of the configuration is standardized. For example to configure the `seeds`option in the p2p section of`config.toml`, for the Akash blockchain: `AKASH\*P2P\*SEEDS=id@node:26656`\\n\\nBelow are examples for each of the environment variables. If you\u2019d like to learn more about these variables, you may want to read the [Cosmos Docs](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/configuration.html#p2p-settings).\\n\\n### &nbsp;**Backup &amp; Restore your Private Key**\\n\\nValidators are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.\\n\\nIf you are running a validator, protecting a validator's consensus key is the most important factor to take in when designing your setup. The key that a validator is given upon creation of the node is called a consensus key, it has to be online at all times in order to vote on blocks.\\n\\nThe Cosmos Omnibus allows the node private keys to be backed up and restored from any S3 compatible storage provider, such as Sia, Skynet, or Storj using Filebase.It\u2019s important to backup your private keys somewhere secure, and it\u2019s important to have a secure method to restore the key when booting back up on Akash. Each time the Cosmos Omnibus containers boot up, they will automatically restore a private key from any S3 storage provider.\\n\\nAkash provides ephemeral storage, which means data stored in the container is erased when the container is shut down. The Cosmos Omnibus solves for this by creating a persistent node ID and validator key on a separate storage.\\n\\n[Filebase](https://filebase.com/) is a great way to use S3 with decentralised hosting such as Sia, Skynet, or Storj. Cosmos Omnibus can use Filebase to backup the `node*key.json`and`priv_validator_key.json`are both backed up, and can be encrypted with a password.\\n\\n### **Set up State Sync**&nbsp;\\n\\nIn proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains using the Tendermint Core, the consensus process involves rounds of communication between the nodes to determine what block should be committed next. Using this process to sync up with the blockchain from scratch can take a very long time. It's much faster to just download blocks and check the merkle tree of validators than to run the real-time consensus gossip protocol. To support faster syncing, Tendermint offers a fast sync mode and a state sync mode.\\n\\nWith fast-sync your node is downloading all of the data of an application from genesis and verifying it. Fast sync is enabled by default, and can be toggled in the`config.toml`or`via --fast_sync=false`.\\n\\nWith state sync your node will download data related to the head or near the head of the chain and verify the data. This leads to drastically shorter times for joining a network. State sync will continuously work in the background to supply nodes with chunked data when bootstrapping.\\n\\nOnce a few nodes in a network have taken state sync snapshots, new nodes can join the network using state sync. When the node is started it will then attempt to find a state sync snapshot in the network and restore it. The new node will state sync and join the network in seconds instead of spending hours downloading the full chain.\\n\\nStatesync requires running twice as many nodes and requires that snapshots are enabled. Fortunately, it\u2019s simple to enable State Sync and Snapshots with the Cosmos Omnibus! Just use the environment variables below.\\n\\n### [Example Statesync Configuration](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/statesync)\\n\\nThis example uses the `STATESYNC_RPC_SERVERS`option which automatically configures statesync from the first node's RPC server. This example includes 2 deployment files:\\n\\n-`snapshot-deploy.yml`for the two snapshotting nodes\\n-`statesync-deploy.yml`for a third state-synced node.\\n\\nWhen you look inside these files you will notice environment variables configuration as described in the table below.\\n\\n### **Bootstrap your Node with Data**\\n\\nNot only can Cosmos Omnibus automatically bootstrap your node with your private key, sync the latest blocks with statesync, but it can restore the node\u2019s data directory from a`.tar`or`.tar.gz`file stored on a public URL. This can be from a specific URL, or from a base URL and a file matching a given pattern**.**\\n\\nYou can configure the bootstrap to restore data from a URL using the environment variables in the chart below.\\n\\n## **DDoS Mitigation with Sentry Nodes**\\n\\nOne of the most common designs to solve for distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) prevention is the [sentry node design](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/sentry-node-architecture-overview/454). On the Cosmos Hub, a validator node can be attacked using the DDoS method. The validator node has a fixed IP address and it opens a RESTful API port facing the Internet.\\n\\nThe sentry node solution provides a way to hide the IP address of the validator node and provide a more easily scalable list of public IP addresses for DDoS mitigation. Multiple distributed nodes (sentry nodes) are deployed in cloud environments and the validator only privately communicates with the sentry nodes. With the possibility of easy scaling (by adding more sentries), it is harder to make an impact on the validator node. New sentry nodes can be brought up during a DDoS attack and they can be integrated into the transaction flow.\\n\\nAll sentry nodes connect to the validator using a private connection. The validator does not have a public IP address to provide its services.\\n\\n### [Example: Validator with Public Sentries](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/validator-and-public-sentries)\\n\\nThis example shows 2 sentry nodes [state-synced from other nodes](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/statesync), with a single private validator node which only connects to the sentries. Note that you should wait for the sentries to get up to date before running the validator, as it will statesync from those sentries. You can expand the sentry setup to as many nodes as required.&nbsp; This example includes 2 deployment files:\\n\\n-`sentries-deploy.yml`to configure the sentry nodes\\n-`validator-deploy.yml`to configure the validator node\\n\\n### [Example: Validator with Private Sentries](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/validator-and-private-sentries)\\n\\nThis example is identical to the [public sentries](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/validator-and-public-sentries) example, but shown with the sentries as part of the same deployment to create a private network. The validator will only talk to the sentries that are provided, the sentry nodes will communicate to the validator via a secret connection and the rest of the network through a normal connection. This example includes a single deployment file:\\n\\n-`deploy.yml` to configure the sentry nodes and validator node\\n\\n# Load Balancing your Nodes&nbsp;\\n\\n### [Example: Load Balanced RPC Nodes](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples/load-balanced-rpc-nodes)\\n\\nThis example details two or more deployments of RPC nodes, and an NGINX deployment to load balance them. The deployment is configured to run multiple RPC containers under a single domain. You can add and remove nodes, but remember to update the load balancer deployment when you do. Ideally your RPC nodes would be configured to sync with statesync nodes as covered in this blog and the [documentation](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/README.md#statesync).\\n\\n# Best Practices\\n\\nNow that you\u2019ve read all about handling your private keys, configuring state sync, restoring from snapshots, sentry node design, and load balancing, you might think there is a lot more work than you realized to run a blockchain node - rather multiple nodes. Fortunately, the Cosmos Omnibus package provides a [directory of examples](https://github.com/tombeynon/cosmos-omnibus/blob/install-and-config/_examples) for all of these common setups. Alternatively you can configure statesync manually using the options we just covered in this blog.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a best practice in node operations is not to rely on any single cloud provider, and that includes the Akash Network. Ideally your deployment is not entirely dependent on the Akash network.

Seven hackers entered; seven won prizes&nbsp; \ud83e\udd73**\\n\\nAs a part of our efforts to accelerate the development of Web3 and DeFi applications, we sponsored the Solana Hackathon with $15,000 in prizes, paid out in AKT.\\n\\nWe presented a total of 4 challenges asking attendees to deploy an open-source application on Akash, integrate it with a separate decentralized storage solution, develop a gateway (bridge) between Akash and Solana blockchains to exchange directly, and develop an integration between Akash and Torus.\\n\\n## 1st Place: Deploy UI\\n\\nIn first place, with a $10,000 prize (2,500 AKT) is the [Akash Deploy UI](https://github.com/tombeynon/akash-deploy) created by Tom Beynon and submitted by [newsystem090](https://github.com/newsystem090) with a key improvement, Keplr wallet integration. We spoke with Deploy UI creator Tom Beynon and [Josh Lee](https://twitter.com/dogemos), CEO of [Chainapsis](https://chainapsis.com/), the team behind Keplr.\\n\\n> \u201cThe Akash Deploy UI makes it easier to manage multiple deployments on Akash in one place, your web browser.\u201d\\n>\\n> Tom Beynon\\n\\nThe Deploy UI tool runs locally on your own machine using Docker and eliminates the need to run CLI commands to deploy on Akash. The integration with Keplr was submitted to the hackathon with a [video demo](https://siasky.net/_A1ZsA1rSXqhvWyV8gIgAkWBJU8potlAbWWI7H1q1jFguw) and a pull request was submitted to the project.\\n\\nKeplr is a browser extension wallet for the Cosmos Interchain ecosystem. Kepler offers account management and wallet functionalities for all of the Cosmos-SDK based blockchains. Keplr has gathered over 30,000 users so far - connecting blockchain users with blockchain applications.\\n\\nTom\u2019s most recent work includes a Pinterest-like app for adoptable dogs and cats with a dynamic NGINX [load balancer](https://github.com/tombeynon/nginx-dynamic-lb) that serves multiple Akash deployments from one domain name, [pin.akash.host](http://pin.akash.host/). Tom says he plans to make it easy to add a load balancer to your deployment,\\n\\n> \u201cAkash Deploy UI could in the future have a 'load balance this deployment' or 'group these deployments and load balance them' feature built into the deployment interface.\u201d\\n>\\n> Tom Beynon\\n\\n## 2nd Place: Kanboard\\n\\nA prize of $1,000 (250 AKT) goes to the second place winner, [Minato Fund](https://minatofund.com/), a team based in Tokyo - the sort of professional-hacker team you\u2019d expect to win a hackathon. The Minato Fund created a deployment file to help developers deploy the open source Kanboard app on Akash.\\n\\n> \u201cAkash is a perfect fit for hosting web apps, and the reason I joined this hackathon was to build a kanban board to manage our project and plan our work.\u201d\\n>\\n> Minato Fund\\n\\nKanboard is a free and open source Kanban project management software. Kanboard can visualize your work, drag and drop tasks to manage your project, and now it can run on Akash Network. The key to deploying Kanboard on Akash is the [open source deployment file](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/pull/175/commits/e1a89f3a04621ef4747e247ce569076f1a9e1f00).\\n\\n## 3rd Place: CLI Wrapper\\n\\nThe third place prize of $1,000 (250 AKT) goes to [CoffeeRoaster](https://twitter.com/roaster4435), for starting work on a new version of the [Akash CLI](https://github.com/coffeeroaster/akash-cli/blob/main/doc/akash-cli.pdf) that will manage environmental variables and wallets. We chatted with CoffeeRoaster who explained his motivation for the project.\\n\\n> \u201cMy main motivation was to be able to easily script deployments. This will help move Akash to the next level and enable 3rd party integrations.\u201d\\n>\\n> CoffeeRoaster\\n\\nWritten in Golang for integration with the existing Akash project, the new CLI will have the ability to automatically sync environmental variables, manage private keys including multisig wallets, and handle the full deployment of creating deployments, logging, and tear-down. This project is not quite finished, and CoffeeRoaster\u2019s work continues.\\n\\n> \u201cI am considering linking to the [Awesome-Akash repo](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) of existing templates to speed up deployments even further.\u201d\\n>\\n> CoffeeRoaster\\n\\n## Solana on Akash Challenge\\n\\nIn the middle of the Solana-Akash livestream for the hackathon, Akash\u2019s CEO Greg Osuri announced a surprise challenge to the hackers: run a Solana node on Akash and write a guide teaching others how to do it. Greg believes that Akash needs well written guides for every blockchain, and offers up roughly $4,000 (1,000 AKT) as a prize.\\n\\nEach with their own writing style, four submissions were submitted via Twitter. We polled the Akash community forum and 218 votes were placed, and the community was excited to participate in the decision making process.

What is the decentralized web? The decentralized web (dWeb) is a major shift from computing resources being owned and operated by the three large cloud software giants (Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) to a decentralized network of cloud providers operating open-source software platforms and creating competition in an open marketplace with more providers and lower costs.\\n\\nThere is no centralized company or project that leads the development of the decentralized web. Sia Skynet and Akash Network are two projects with the same goal, to make it easy to join the decentralized Internet movement. Both are hosting platforms with strong developer communities releasing new code and projects every day. Both are well-funded and are openly challenging the cloud giants by reducing the cost for users to host their data and apps. Even the names have a similarity - Akash means \\&quot;sky\\&quot; in ancient Sanskrit.\\n\\n### **Which hosting platform is better, Akash or Skynet?**&nbsp;\\n\\nActually, they work better together. The Akash Network provides decentralized compute, and Skynet through its underlying Sia network provides decentralized storage. By bringing together the compute and storage layers, developers can host their applications on a fully decentralized cloud. The developer communities also benefit from the network effect; as more users and developers switch to a decentralized architecture, more contributions are made to these open source projects.\\n\\n### **What\u2019s so Pinteresting?**\\n\\nThe first example of an integration that combines Akash and Skynet is a clone of Pinterest, now live at the website [http://pin.akash.host](https://pin.akash.host/). The Pinterest app runs a Postgres database on Akash and backs up the container to Skynet\u2019s decentralized storage servers.\\n\\n### **How does Skynet work?**\\n\\nSkynet provides decentralized storage, and unlike the traditional web, files uploaded to Skynet are immutable. Immutable data means you can upload files, and they are instantly accessible on any device and are fully verifiable on the Sia blockchain. As long as at least one public portal continues to pin the data, it will remain accessible forever.\\n\\nSkynet also includes SDKs for popular programming languages - built with Web 2.0 developers in mind. Client-side web apps and static generators are perfect for using [Skynet](http://siasky.net/) to deploy. Skynet also supports mutable data with SkyDB, a key-value store.\\n\\n### **How does Akash Network work?**\\n\\nAkash is an open-source deployment platform for hosting and managing containers where users can run any cloud-native application. The open-source nature of Akash\u2019s platform allows it to be implemented across multiple cloud providers, breaking the vendor lock-in for selecting a cloud-hosted service.\\n\\nThe Akash platform is built with a set of cloud management services including Kubernetes to automate the deployment of containers and ensure the reliability of applications and workloads running on the containers. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is open-source and not designed specifically for any cloud provider.\\n\\nAkash is ideally suited for hosting any app that can run in a container including Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, fully featured databases like MySQL and Postgres, GraphQL APIs, and anything that you can find on Docker Hub (more on that later).\\n\\n### **How do you integrate? Enter Filebase!**\\n\\nThe Pinterest app backs up to Skynet using [Filebase](https://filebase.com/), a company that recently raised a $2M seed round to provide encrypted and geo-redundant storage at a fraction of the price of Amazon and other centralized storage providers.\\n\\nFilebase\u2019s S3 Compatible API functions as a drop-in replacement for existing applications and tools that use Amazon S3, and Filebase\u2019s backend connects to both Sia and Skynet enabling data to be stored at the lowest cost possible. Filebase object storage has also been validated for use with several Kubernetes backup tools.\\n\\nWith this integration from Filebase, apps running on Akash can now backup, restore, and migrate a database by connecting the containers running on Akash to persistent storage on Skynet. The [Akash documentation site](http://docs.akash.network/) has been updated with the official guides to run your own [Pinterest app on Rails](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails) and a spin off to simply [backup and restore Postgres](https://akash.network/docs/deploy/postgresql-restore-backup) to Skynet storage.\\n\\n### **The \u201cFull Stack\u201d Integration**\\n\\nOne challenge for new developers is making architecture decisions on which stack they should run. Not every developer wants to build their app the same way as the Pinterest-clone. For a web application to work, it has to include an operating system, a web server, a database for storage, and a programming language. The widely popular LAMP stack is a set of open-source software including Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and became the foundation for Linux hosted web applications.\\n\\nAkash Founder and CEO, Greg Osuri launched a [challenge on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregosuri/status/1390090199728676864) offering a $2,140 reward for the first developer to integrate Akash and [Skynet](http://siasky.net/) with a unique requirement, use Skynet as the front-end and Akash as the back-end to create a \u201cfull-stack\u201d decentralized web application.\\n\\nThis challenge was met quickly by the developers in the Akash and Skynet community. The [Unstoppable Web 2.0](https://akash.network/docs/deploy/unstoppable-web-2.0) project includes everything necessary for a fully decentralized web app. The application code, technology choices, and configuration used in this project provides a software development tool kit for future developers. The solution uses Skynet for the front-end, Akash for the back-end - running Postgres, and Filebase for the database backups to Skynet.\\n\\nThe full stack solution for a decentralized web is now a reality, with&nbsp;[Skynet](http://siasky.net/)&nbsp;as the front-end, Akash as the back-end app and database, and Filebase and Skynet as the backup. Each step of this partnership has been supported and developed by the community.\\n\\n### **Decentralizing Docker Hub**\\n\\nAkash plans to support these efforts long-term through community-targeted funding. While building apps in containers is easy, not every project needs to be built from scratch. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a SaaS repository for sharing and managing containers, where you will find official Docker images from open-source projects and software vendors as well as unofficial images from the general public.\\n\\n[OpenRegistry](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-an-open-container-registry/76/10) is a new project to make Docker Hub redundant, and replace it with a decentralized version. With support from Akash and Skynet, OpenRegistry is building a new container registry that would be compatible with any container engine. Many developers rely on Docker\u2019s Container Registry, but unfortunately it\u2019s a centralized repository owned and operated by Docker, a single corporate entity.\\n\\nJasdeep Singh, the founder of OpenRegistry explained to the [Akash community](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-an-open-container-registry/76), \u201cwhen Docker Hub goes down, it causes a lot of service degradation for the entire industry. Docker\u2019s new rate-limiting makes it even harder to use Docker.\u201d\\n\\nFortune 500 companies have been forced to use alternatives to Docker\u2019s container registry, including Amazon\u2019s centralized version. Mr. Singh added \u201cWe can show the tech industry how resilient and robust Akash Network is for Fault Tolerant Systems.\u201d\\n\\n**Join The Unstoppable Stack on Twitter Spaces June 29th at 6 pm PST!**\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network and Skynet Labs Provide a Full Stack for the Unstoppable Web &quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Everyone knows the term DeFi, but dWeb, or decentralized web, is still catching on in the lexicon of the mainstream press.

That\u2019s why we were excited to announce our first decentralized exchange listing of AKT on Osmosis.\\n\\nWith the successful launch of Osmosis, the first IBC-enabled decentralized exchange, for the first time ever, any developer or AKT buyer can now access AKT in a permissionless and frictionless way, from anywhere in the world, swap, and earn rewards for providing liquidity for AKT and any other IBC-enabled asset.\\n\\nThe feedback has been resoundingly positive with users around the world praising Osmosis\u2019s slick and easy to navigate user interface. Osmosis was designed to be accessible to a wide range of users from beginners to seasoned DeFi Degens.\\n\\nWith Over $50 million in TVL (total locked value) accrued in less than a a week and extremely attractive rewards for providing liquidity and staking, Osmosis is a must use.\\n\\nThis guide will walk you through how to use Osmosis\u2019s key features from start to finish. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ve divided this guide into three main sections:\\n\\n1. Funding your Osmosis account\\n2. Swapping assets\\n3. Providing liquidity\\n\\n**\*1\\\\.\*** **How to Fund Your Osmosis Account** \\n\\\\*\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 1.1: Buy ATOM**\\n\\nYou can purchase ATOM from every major exchange in the world. Below are a number of exchanges you can use:\\n\\n[Coinbase](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ATOM-USD)\\n\\n[Kraken](https://trade.kraken.com/markets/kraken/atom/usd)\\n\\n[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/ATOM_USDT)\\n\\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ATOM_USDT)\\n\\n**Step 1.2: Install the** [**Keplr Wallet**](https://keplr.xyz/) **browser extension**\\n\\nIn order to use Osmosis you need to create a Keplr Wallet. Go to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) and click the \u201cAdd to chrome\u201d button at the top right of your screen.\\n\\n**Step 1.3: Create a Keplr wallet**\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve installed the Keplr Wallet browser extension follow the instructions in this [Keplr wallet setup guide](https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6).\\n\\n**Step 1.4: Send ATOM to your Keplr Wallet**\\n\\n**Step 1.5: Open Osmosis**\\n\\nNow that you have ATOMs in your Keplr Wallet, you\u2019re going to want to [open Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/).\\n\\n**Step 1.6: Connecting your Wallet**\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve opened the Osmosis web app, you need to connect your Keplr Wallet. Sign in to your Keplr wallet extension if you haven\u2019t yet, and click \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d at the bottom left of the Osmosis page.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624502963-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-7-09-32-pm.png)\\n\\n**Step 1.7: Depositing assets into Osmosis**\\n\\nNow, this is the first time you\u2019ll be using IBC! In order to use Osmosis, please follow these next steps:\\n\\n1. You need to transfer your assets from your Keplr wallet to Osmosis by using Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). IBC enables different blockchain protocols built with Cosmos SDK to exchange value between each other.\\n2. Go to the menu on the left of the Osmosis page and click \u201cAssets.\u201d On the Assets page, there is a list of available assets including ATOM. Immediately to the right of ATOM you\u2019ll see a \u201cDeposit\u201d button. You\u2019ll want to click deposit\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503086-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-7-26-14-pm.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503176-deposit.png)\\n\\n(there are instances where IBC assets take a few minutes to populate. Be patient and refresh your screen. If there are issues, you can get support in the Osmosis [Discord](https://discord.gg/qwC4yfCw))\\n\\n*2*. How to Swap \\n\*\*\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 2.1: Swapping**\\n\\nNow you\u2019re ready to swap! Click on the \u201cTrade\u201d tab located at the top left of your screen on Osmosis\\n\\nGo ahead and choose which assets you\u2019re swapping from and to. For the purposes of this guide, we\u2019ll be swapping ATOM to AKT. Because of the set ratio of the AKT <> ATOM pool, you will want to swap 2 / 3 of your ATOM into AKT in order to provide liquidity to the pool.\\n\\nFor some of you, your journey will end here. You can swap any amount of your ATOM for AKT or any other IBC-enabled asset and send that asset back to your Keplr Wallet.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503442-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-2-35-36-pm.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503561-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-2-35-36-pm.png)\\n\\n**Important to note:** Make sure when you are swapping to be mindful of slippage. What is slippage? Slippage is the expected % difference between the quoted and executed price. Selling too much of one asset into the pool can increase slippage and destabilize the pool if there isn\u2019t enough liquidity.\\n\\nAs a recommendation, you don\u2019t want slippage to exceed roughly 2%.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503542-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-2-45-33-pm.png)\\n\\n**TIP:** Click settings at the top right of the Swap menu and set your slippage tolerance to 1% just in case.\\n\\n3\\\\. How to Add Liquidity to a Pool \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor some of you the journey hasn\u2019t ended and by this point you already have both ATOM and AKT and are ready to add liquidity to the ATOM <> AKT pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n**Step 3.1: Choosing a pool**\\n\\nClick the \u201cPools\u201d button on the options menu to the left of the Osmosis page and you\u2019re going to see a number of liquidity pools from the Cosmos ecosystem that are supported and IBC-enabled.\\n\\nEach card will show you the Pool number, the asset pair in that specific pool, the estimated APY for providing liquidity, and the pool\u2019s overall liquidity.\\n\\nFor the sake of this guide you\u2019ll be choosing Pool #4, the AKT <> ATOM pool.\\n\\n**Step 3.2: Adding liquidity**\\n\\nYou\u2019ve chosen the AKT <> ATOM pool, now you need to add liquidity to that pool. In order to do that, click the \u201cAdd / Remove Liquidity\u201d button at the top of your screen. Remember that the AKT<> ATOM pool is a 2-to-1 pool, meaning 2/3rds of the value of the pool will be in AKT and 1/3rd will be in ATOM\\n\\nAdd the amount of ATOM and AKT you would like to provide to this pool to become a Liquidity Provider and earn OSMO and AKT rewards\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1624503715-screen-shot-2021-06-23-at-3-22-01-pm.png)\\n\\n**Step 3.3: Bonding your LP Tokens**\\n\\n*This is the final step and an important one.*\\n\\n45% of daily issuance of OSMO rewards will go towards incentivizing liquidity providers to bond their LP tokens to promote long-term liquidity on Osmosis\u2019 AMM. Osmosis users can also choose to bond their LP tokens after providing liquidity. Similar to OSMO staking, LP tokens remain bonded for a certain length of time, except users are allowed to choose the length of their own unbonding period.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll see three bonding gauges below: 1 day, 7 days, and 14 days with the respective APY of each pool.

We announced that [we partnered with Helium Network](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-provides-decentralized-cloud-to-the-largest-internet-of-things-iot), the largest peer-to-peer wireless internet-of-things (IoT) network, to provide a decentralized, open-source, and low-cost cloud alternative for Helium\u2019s new blockchain validators.\\n\\nWe also [welcomed the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta to Akash Network as an investor and validator](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/nbas-houston-rockets-owner-to-validate-blocks-for-the-akash-network-2527433). Fertitta, an early Bitcoin supporter, has a track record of leveraging emerging technology and is working towards migrating his business empire\u2019s cloud computing needs to Akash DeCloud.\\n\\nWith deployments on Akash increasing over 20% week on week, the need to expand access to AKT for our users has never been greater. As the primary method of settlement for compute on the Akash decentralized cloud, AKT is the utility token that enables the frictionless buying and selling of compute.\\n\\nAs the demand for AKT increases with network usage, one of our primary goals is to unlock Akash Network\u2019s acceleration and expand global access to AKT without arbitrary access restrictions; the decentralized cloud requires decentralized access.\\n\\n**Wider Global Access to AKT** \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**So it\u2019s with great excitement that we announce our very first decentralized exchange listing of AKT on Osmosis shortly after the Osmosis Mainnet launch this Saturday, June 19th.**\\n\\n**We\u2019re also thrilled to be hosting Osmosis applications and API-serving nodes on Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud.**\\n\\n**With Osmosis, any developer or AKT buyer can now access AKT in a permissionless and frictionless way, from anywhere in the world.

Early liquidity providers receive a larger proportion of rewards in both OSMO and AKT.**\\n\\nFor the Cosmos superfan and humble farmers, this is the start of IBC\u2019s potential being realized. For the first time, Osmosis users will be able to&nbsp; directly swap ATOMs for AKT, and bring Cosmos\u2019s fully interoperable ecosystem to life.\\n\\nAkash Network\u2019s main goal is to increase access to lower cost, scalable, and developer friendly cloud compute in an open-source and permissionless environment. Listing AKT on a DEX aligns fundamentally with our ethos and vision for a decentralized future.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1623890938-1wkfqvrq3idonzv6tuyqttq.png)\\n\\n**What is Osmosis?** \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\nOsmosis is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol built for liquidity providers. With Osmosis, users are able to&nbsp; swap cross-chain assets within the Cosmos ecosystem and provide liquidity for IBC-enabled Cosmos assets like AKT and ATOM for the first time while earning OSMO and AKT rewards.\\n\\n**Why Participate in Osmosis?** \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\nUser experience is critical to the success of any trading protocol and one of the biggest obstacles in creating a consistent and reliable trading experience is short-term mercenary farming where liquidity providers quickly add and remove liquidity to pursue the best yields. With that in mind, Osmosis has leveraged two novel devices to encourage long term liquidity: Bonded liquidity Gauges and Exit fees (a fee LPs pay when withdrawing liquidity from a pool).\\n\\n45% of daily issuance of OSMO rewards will go towards incentivizing liquidity providers to bond their LP tokens to promote long-term liquidity on Osmosis\u2019 AMM. Osmosis users can also choose to bond their LP tokens after providing liquidity. Similar to OSMO staking, LP tokens remain bonded for a certain length of time, except users are allowed to choose the length of their own unbonding period. Staking requires a two-week unbonding period.\\n\\nTo further promote \u2018long-lasting incentive programs\u2019, the Osmosis team has enabled external incentives by outside parties to supplement Osmosis\u2019 own liquidity programs. This&nbsp; provides Akash Network\u2019s team the capability and flexibility to incentivize with additional rewards for bonding gauges that promote the overall health and liquidity of pools that include AKT, such as our initial AKT/ATOMs, or potential future pools within the Cosmos ecosystem, like Terra\u2019s $Luna, Binance\u2019s $BNB, or Thorchains $Rune.\\n\\nFor a deeper dive into bonded liquidity gauges and other features that make Osmosis so unique, read [Osmosis\u2019 Liquidity Mining 101.](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d)\\n\\n**Osmosis AKT Timeline**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Osmosis Chain Launch: June 18th 5PM UTC\\n- Osmosis Public Launch: June 19th 5PM UTC\\n- AKT LP Rewards turned on: Earliest on June 21st\\n\\n**Join The Unstoppable Cloud Community**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor the latest AKT and Akash Network news and promotions, [join our Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW).\\n\\nFor developer support, [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67).\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Announces First AKT Token DEX Listing on Osmosis&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We\u2019re excited to have Akash Network be one of the first launch partners of Osmosis.

Not only is their performance and cost structure attractive to node operators, but their decentralized cloud aligns with our own ethos of creating permissionless and open systems.\\n>\\n> Scott Sigel, Director of Operations at the Decentralized Wireless Alliance, the nonprofit foundation arm of the Helium Network\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019ve been selected to support the Helium Network, the largest peer-to-peer wireless internet-of-things (IoT) network, and providing a decentralized, open-source, and low-cost cloud alternative for Helium\u2019s new blockchain validators, projected to launch June 2021.\\n\\nValidators will play an integral role in the expansion, stability, and success of the Helium network, acting as the consensus group, and performing functions that include verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain.\\n\\nAkash Network is proud to be providing a faster, more efficient, and low-cost deployment and hosting solution for the Helium validator software.\\n\\nAs part of today\u2019s announcement, I\u2019ll be sharing how I learned to run a Helium validator on Akash, along with providing a detailed deployment guide.\\n\\n### **How I learned to run a Helium Validator on Akash in one day**\\n\\nSome people can dive into documentation and figure something out in an hour, but for someone like me, it can take a&nbsp;**_whole_**&nbsp;day. Fortunately, this article covers the step-by-step process of deploying a Helium Validator on the Akash decentralized cloud (DeCloud). By end of day, you\u2019ll have a Helium Validator running on&nbsp;[Akash](https://akash.network/)&nbsp;DeCloud\u200a\u2014\u200aand you don\u2019t need to be a developer.\\n\\n_**If you already know about Helium Validators, skip to the technical step-by-step section.**_\\n\\n### **Why am I so excited about Helium?**\\n\\nToday, the Helium blockchain, and its&nbsp;[30,000+ hotspots](https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots)&nbsp;provide access to the largest Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) in the world. By deploying a simple device at your home or office, you are helping provide coverage for billions of devices and earning cryptocurrency.\\n\\nHelium was started in 2013; MIT called&nbsp;[2013: The year of the Internet of Things](https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/01/04/180666/2013-the-year-of-the-internet-of-things/). It was the early days, when people still called it \u201cThe IoT\u201d. Helium\u2019s innovative LongFi technology is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with enhancements to harden security, increase bandwidth, and simplify ease of use. In 2014, I signed up for the Helium Beta Kit, and I still have my original Helium Atom to this day. Helium\u2019s VP&nbsp;[Mark Phillips](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-phillips-255b757/)&nbsp;even emailed me directly asking me to do some beta testing. I felt special to be part of something new.\\n\\nThe Helium blockchain and HNT launched in 2019 and sparked a massive growth in Helium\u2019s network. If you were one of the early adopters, you\u2019ve been mining HNT, and it\u2019s likely paid off much more than the cost of the hotspot. Hotspots use Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) to verify wireless coverage from peers and earn rewards for providing coverage and transferring device data. A single Helium hotspot in the right neighborhood can earn over $12,000 (USD) in monthly HNT mining rewards.\\n\\nNew partnerships and customers are coming to Helium\u2019s network including&nbsp;[FreedomFi](https://freedomfi.com/helium5g/)\u2019s Helium5G network which pays people to host a 5G hotspot and reward them with HNT.\\n\\n#### **Helium Validators are right around the corner.**\\n\\nHelium\u2019s Validators are a new entity on the Helium Blockchain that will perform the work of the consensus group including verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Helium Validators are projected to go live on their Mainnet by June 2021, and possibly sooner.\\n\\nTo host a Validator node requires a stake (deposit) of 10,000 HNT and running Validator node software in a suitable environment. In return for staking, users contribute to network stability and earn rewards.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1622233046-colin-1.png)\\n\\n#### **Mining with Validators vs. Hotspots**\\n\\nValidators split the Consensus Group reward,&nbsp;[which is 6% of all HNT mined](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/mining/#mining-and-token-rewards). Approximately 300,000 HNT is split evenly amongst validators every month. Initial validator size is somewhere between 100 and 500. Early stakers will earn a larger % of the 300,000 HNT.\\n\\nCompared with Helium hotspots, the earnings are split evenly amongst routers. There are currently over 30,000 routers and many more joining the network every day\u200a, \u200areducing each routers individual earnings.\\n\\n#### **What is the APR for running Helium Validator?**\\n\\nIt depends on the number of validators and how often a validator is randomly chosen to participate in the consensus group. Helium\u2019s website depicts an estimated APR represented assuming 10k HNT per node.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1622233062-colin-2.png)\\n\\n### **Why run on Akash?**\\n\\nAkash is the first open-source and decentralized Cloud. Akash\u2019s peer-to-peer marketplace offers the most flexible and cost-effective options for a developer to deploy their app.\\n\\n- **Efficient:**&nbsp;Pay for what you need, when needed. Akash lets you set the price, length of lease, and terms of your deployment.\\n- **Flexible:**&nbsp;Compatible with all existing cloud applications. Akash Network supports generic compute\u200a\u2014\u200aany cloud native applications running on the cloud today (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), can run on Akash.\\n- **Price Advantage:**&nbsp;Up to 10x lower in cost for developers. Helium Validators can run on Akash without worrying about running up an expensive bill from Amazon.\\n- **Censorship-resistant**: Akash is founded on the principle of permissionless open access and does not decide who can use the marketplace.\\n- **Open-source:**&nbsp;Purpose built for \u201cbuilders\u201d by some of the top developers in the world. Akash is a community-driven open source project that allows anyone to contribute.\\n\\nWith advanced containerization technology and a unique staking model to accelerate adoption, Akash will be a faster, more efficient, and up to 10x lower cost cloud platform.\\n\\n### **How to run a Helium Validator on Akash**\\n\\nThis section is sourced from Tom Beynon\u2019s&nbsp;[**Helium-on-Akash**](https://github.com/tombeynon/helium-on-akash)&nbsp;project and&nbsp;[**Helium\u2019s Validator Deployment Guide**](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/validator-deployment-guide/). If you run into any issues or have feedback, feel free to join&nbsp;[**Akash\u2019s Discord Chat**](http://chat/)&nbsp;and ask me for help. My name on Discord is @colinster.\\n\\nValidators currently can only run on Helium\u2019s Testnet\u200a\u2014\u200a a network designed to deploy and test new software for beta testing\u200a\u2014\u200abefore going live on their Mainnet\u200a\u2014\u200aor production network. This means you\u2019ll be deploying to the Testnet until Mainnet is live. This guide reflects deploying to the Testnet only. This guide will be updated when Validators are ready for MainNet.\\n\\n#### **Step 1. Set Up a Helium Testnet Wallet**&nbsp;\\n\\n- Install the&nbsp;[Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs). The easy way to download the latest binary release. Download the latest binary for your platform here from&nbsp;[Releases](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/releases/latest). Unpack the zip file and place the helium-wallet binary in your $PATH somewhere.\\n- Once you have your&nbsp;[Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs)&nbsp;installed locally, it\u2019s time to create your Testnet Wallet. Run the following command to create it.\\n\\n  helium-wallet create basic--network testnet\\n\\n- You\u2019ll be prompted to supply a new passphrase to complete it. This is used to encrypt/decrypt the wallet.key file, and is needed to sign transactions. Don't lose it.\\n- This command will produce a wallet.key file on your machine.\\n- Next, run the info command to get all the details for your wallet.\\n\\n  helium-wallet info\\n\\n#### **Step 2. Get Testnet Tokens (TNT)**\\n\\nRunning a Validator requires a stake. This stake is 10000 tokens per Validator. For the Testnet we are using TNTs.\\n\\nTo acquire them, head to&nbsp;[faucet.helium.wtf](https://faucet.helium.wtf/)&nbsp;and input your public key from the wallet you just created. Use your public wallet address. If you copy and paste, the one above the TNT will be sent to someone else.\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve inputted your address, the Faucet will deliver just over 10000 TNT to your Testnet Wallet. This can take up to 10 minutes so please be patient. Make a cup of coffee, issue a compelling tweet, then check your wallet balance using the balance command:\\n\\n    helium-wallet balance\\n\\n#### **Step 3. Set Up an Akash Mainnet Wallet**\\n\\n- [Install the Akash CLI](https://akash.network/docs/guides/install). To installakashusing homebrew just enter:\\n\\n  brew tap ovrclk/tap\\n  brew install akash\\n  brew link akash --force\\n\\n- Set the variable AKASH_NET to the URL of the Akash MainNet.&nbsp;[You can also choose to deploy on Testnet or Edgenet.](https://akash.network/docs/guides/version)&nbsp;Enter the following command on your command prompt to set the variable.\\n\\n  AKASH_NET=\\&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/net/master/mainnet\\&quot;\\n\\n- Set the variable AKASH_VERSION to the URL of the Akash MainNet\\n\\n  AKASH_VERSION=\\&quot;$(curl -s \\&quot;$AKASH_NET/version.txt\\&quot;)\\&quot;\\n\\n- Set the variable AKASH_CHAIN_ID environment variable:\\n\\n  AKASH_CHAIN_ID=\\&quot;$(curl -s \\&quot;$AKASH_NET/chain-id.txt\\&quot;)\\&quot;\\n\\n- Set the variable AKASH_NODE environment variable:\\n\\n  AKASH_NODE=\\&quot;$(curl -s \\&quot;$AKASH_NET/rpc-nodes.txt\\&quot; | shuf -n 1)\\&quot;\\n\\n- Set the variable AKASH_KEY_NAME to the Key name of your choosing. This documentation uses a value of \u201calice\u201d.\\n- Set the variableAKASH_KEYRING_BACKEND Keyring backend to use for local keys. This should be os (default), file, ortest.\\n- Derive a new private key and encrypt to disk using the command keys add, to generate a key with the named alice, run the below:\\n\\n  akash \\\\\\n  --keyring-backend \\&quot;$AKASH*KEYRING_BACKEND\\&quot; \\\\\\n keys add \\&quot;$AKASH_KEY_NAME\\&quot;\\n\\nYou\u2019ll see a response similar to below:\\n\\n    - name: alice\\n    type: local\\n    address: akash1cz87pqkad72gggrv3t7y2x9z56h9gqghlnx3j3\\n    pubkey: akashpub1addwnpepqtnydvj056gy64uuquldq5yx7mr8ncmn3ut59wwl9p83d8h2v4rtg5xa3vn\\n    mnemonic: \\&quot;\\&quot;\\n    threshold: 0\\n    pubkeys: []\\n    **Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.

Get Akash Tokens**\\n\\nThe easy way to get Akash Tokens (AKT) is to purchase them on&nbsp;[exchanges listed here](https://akash.network/token/). From there you can withdraw tokens to your address.\\n\\nAnother easy way to get Akash Tokens is to join&nbsp;[Akash\u2019s Discord Chat](http://chat/)&nbsp;and ask me directly for help. My name on Discord is @colinster.\\n\\nCheck your account balance with the following CLI command:\\n\\n    akash \\\\\\n    --node \\&quot;$AKASH_NODE\\&quot; \\\\\\n query bank balances \\&quot;$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS\\&quot;\\n\\n#### **Step 5. Configure your Deployment**\\n\\nThe easiest way to deploy a Helium validator is using the working example of a deployment configuration for Akash. Clone the&nbsp;[**Helium-on-Akash**](https://github.com/tombeynon/helium-on-akash)&nbsp;from GitHub which includes three important files:\\n\\n- Dockerfile - Installs the AWS CLI on top of the&nbsp;[Helium validator docker image](https://quay.io/team-helium/validator)&nbsp;and sets boot.sh to run whenever the container starts.\\n- boot.sh - This script instructs the docker container to download swarm_key from S3 (if it exists), start the miner and prints the address. It then uploads the swarm_key if it didn't download it earlier (new miner).\\n- deploy.yml - The deployment configuration is stored in the deploy.yml file, which includes all the important information including CPU, memory, storage, port configuration.\\n\\nEnter your S3 bucket and IAM credentials into the env section. These settings will allow the container to connect to your S3 bucket and upload/download the swarm_key on boot.&nbsp;[Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to set up your S3 bucket.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example1.html#grant-permissions-to-user-in-your-account-step1)\\n\\nIf you have a swarm_key already, make sure this is uploaded to S3 in the same location as S3_KEY_PATH.\\n\\n image: tombeynon/helium-on-akash:v0.0.3\\n env:\\n \u2014 AWS_ACCESS_KEY=mykey\\n \u2014 AWS_SECRET_KEY=mysecret\\n \u2014 S3_KEY_PATH=mybucket/miner1/swarm_key\\n\\n#### **Step 6. Deploy on Akash**\\n\\nYou can deploy your Validator on Akash using the Akash CLI following the&nbsp;[Akash deployment guide](https://akash.network/docs/guides/deploy)&nbsp;or using Tom Beynon\u2019s&nbsp;[Deploy UI](https://github.com/tombeynon/akash-deploy).\\n\\nOnce the container is deployed, check the logs to see your address once the server starts (can take a while). If your swarm_key didn\u2019t exist in S3 before, the new one should have been uploaded. Subsequent deploys using the same S3 details will now use the same swarm_key.\\n\\n#### **Step 7: Stake Tokens to Your Validator**\\n\\nNow that your Validator node is running, the final step in the process is to formally stake TNT to your Validator. As part of the staking process the Validator address needs to both be in the staking transaction and sign the transaction.\\n\\nAfter a wallet stakes a validator node, the wallet becomes that node\u2019s owner, has control over that validator node, and receives rewards.\\n\\nFirst, double check your wallet balance to make sure you have the 10000 TNT required to stake, along with a few extra to cover the transaction fees. (The faucet provides all of this.)\\n\\n helium-wallet balance\\n +-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+\\n | Address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Balance&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Data Credits | Security Tokens |\\n +-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+\\n | 1aP7nm6mGLMFtgiHQQxbPgKcBwnuQ6ehgTgTN8zjFuxByzJ8eA5 | 10005.00000000 | 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0.00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |\\n +-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+\\n\\nTo stake tokens, we need to get the validator node address. Obtain it using the following:\\n\\n miner peer addr\\n\\nThe resulting output will look like this (except with your specific validator address).

The learning curve was small, and Akash's community members quickly and selflessly answered the questions I had. I went from just knowing about Akash's existence to actually deploying on their decentralized cloud in a very short time frame.*\\n> \\n> EoM Games\\n\\nEoM\u2019s work excited the core development teams at Akash and Sovryn, the DeFi platform for Bitcoin, inspiring both teams to explore ways to work together.\\n\\nWith a shared goal to accelerate the future of DeFi, Akash is providing our DeCloud to participants and committing $100,000 in Akash Token (AKT) prizes for the&nbsp;[Sovrython Hackathon, powered by Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/sovrython/onboard).&nbsp;\\n\\nThe hackathon kicks off June 4th and runs through July 18th, 2021. With over $500,000 in awards and grants, this event will be the highest value DeFi Hackathon bounty program ever offered on Gitcoin.\\n\\n> _Sovryn is enabling DeFi for the most valuable blockchain, Bitcoin. This is a game-changer because Sovryn is the first smart contract platform for Bitcoin to enable the DeFi ecosystem, and hosting Sovryn on Akash\u2019s decentralized and open-source cloud is a big win for both teams.  \\n> This partnership gives Sovryn an advantage over other DeFi ecosystems by tapping into Akash\u2019s powerful middleware layer for developers--critical for a better end-user experience. Sponsoring Sovryn\u2019s hackathon is an important way of empowering our community members by funding their projects._\\n> \\n> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network\\n\\nCurrently, we see web apps running on Akash, Sovryn nodes running on Akash, and dApps with a UI or middleware layer running on Akash. In the future, we see The Unstoppable Cloud running smart contracts on Sovryn, the blockchain nodes and middleware on Akash, static client-side Javascript on a decentralized CDN like Filebase and Sia, and finally, DNS from Handshake.&nbsp;\\n\\n> _Akash Network\u2019s value proposition - and I mean this in an ethical sense - grabbed Sovryn's attention immediately when it first crossed our radar. Then we discovered their second value proposition of competitive pricing for serving data and infrastructure on distributed and decentralized networks, paired with the right economic incentives to ensure permanence in an adversarial environment. Having Akash join our Sovrython allows us to jointly develop productive relationships with developers looking to securely serve the next generation of DeFi infrastructure._\\n> \\n> exiledsurfer, Sovrython Producer\\n\\n#### **Deploy Sovryn on Akash DeCloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nCheck out&nbsp;[our guide on how to deploy Sovryn on Akash DeCloud](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/tree/master/sovryn-node).&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Akash Livestream with Sovryn**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nTune in to our YouTube livestream at 9 am PST this&nbsp;**Friday, May 21st to watch**&nbsp;our CEO, Greg Osuri, and Sovrython Producer, exiledsurfer unveil our hackathon challenges!&nbsp;[Get a reminder, here.](https://youtu.be/PUBL4eguqq4)&nbsp;\\n\\n[**Sign up**](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/sovrython/onboard)&nbsp;**to participate in the Sovrython Hackathon and be sure**&nbsp;[**to join us on Discord for dev support**](http://discord.akash.network/)&nbsp;**during the hackathon!**&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network Provides Decentralized Cloud and $100k in AKT Prizes for Sovrython Hackathon to Accelerate the Future of DeFi&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the past year, we\u2019ve expanded our community of Akashians across the U.S., Europe, China, Korea, and Russia, and we\u2019re thankful for the passion and contributions that our global community members have brought to our ecosystem.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Kelsey Ruiz&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.Dmts9vze.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1024],&quot;height&quot;:[0,768],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-network-provides-decentralized-cloud-and-100k-in-akt-prizes-for-sovrython-hackathon/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-sponsors-solana-season-hackathon-to-accelerate-web-3-defi/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-sponsors-solana-season-hackathon-to-accelerate-web-3-defi&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nLast year, [we announced a partnership with Solana](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-solana-to-bring-web-scale-smart-contracts-to-supercloud/) to bring web-scale smart contracts to Akash\u2019s decentralized and open-source cloud (DeCloud).\\n\\nAs we shared, Akash users will be able to leverage Solana\u2019s hyper-performant platform to run secure and scalable smart contracts and pay using Akash Token (AKT).

I feel like I\u2019m joining a rocketship that\u2019s about to lift off.\\n\\nA healthy, passionate, and self-sustaining global community is critical to materializing the vision of the world\u2019s first open-source cloud.\\n\\nYou may not know this, but Akash\u2019s current global community is only over a year and a half old. Over the past year, Michael Gushansky, Akash\u2019s marketing and community Jack-of-all-trades, has built and scaled The Unstoppable Cloud community into one of the fastest growing and largest communities in the Cosmos ecosystem, while also earning a devoted following of his own for his \u201cUnstoppable\u201d hair.\\n\\nQuick Akash Community Stats over 1 year:\\n\\n- 30,700+ Twitter followers and counting\\n- 13,500+ Telegram members--one of the largest in the Cosmos ecosystem\\n- 3 Chinese Community Summits with 4,000+ attendees each\\n- Established Akash Russian Telegram as the largest in the Cosmos Ecosystem\\n- 70+ global AMAs\\n\\nWe expanded our global community to China with the help of our Chinese Community Manager and Ourea Group (OG) co-founder Alex Wang, to Russia through the diligent efforts of our Russian Community Manager Andrew Hnatiuk, and we\u2019re making in-roads into Korea, and have plans underway to support additional Akash communities around the world.\\n\\nAs we accelerate Akash\u2019s next stage of growth, Michael Gushansky is transitioning fully into his global marketing role to drive campaign management and demand generation, helping expand product awareness and adoption.\\n\\nTo continue scaling our global community, while building an exceptional member experience, we needed to find the right community lead, and we searched for a long time (over 6 months!) to find the right person.\\n\\n**Today, we\u2019re excited to introduce you to Adam Wozney, our new Senior Global Community and Social Media Manager. Adam will be leading online and offline community programs that drive engagement with Akash and Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud (DeCloud), and help enable, educate, and inspire our global crypto and developer communities.**\\n\\n**(Adam will also continue our tradition of Community leads with good hair.)**\\n\\n#### **From Google to ConsenSys, Ten Years of Community Building**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nCurious and customer-centric, Adam brings a decade of community building and management experience at leading technology companies.\\n\\nBefore Akash, Adam developed and launched community initiatives at IEX Cloud, a fintech startup. Prior to that, he served as Director of Community during a pivotal period of growth for ConsenSys, where he quickly scaled community programs and built a passionate community for the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting Ethereum\u2019s wider adoption, and grew the developer community to 60,000 members.\\n\\nPrior to ConsenSys, Adam managed content, events, and community at Wix, and drove field marketing programs at Google.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620927058-balgookqgzom2ssjxy7kooolhmer5uwosvp8xkistkh6oau2uwvand30yt2elixq1a2tjtdalx4hjobprj59ezxfuyd91ghr67o5zyopcvg88qni2ecmsiee-ttbqlfb0cqgi.jpeg)\\n\\nWhat struck me most about Adam, a self-professed \u201csociologist at heart\u201d, was his curiosity, his willingness to listen, and his inclusive customer-centricity--the combination of attributes we were looking for in our Global Community leader.\\n\\n> _The more you walk in other people\u2019s shoes, the better community builder you can become. To build an inclusive, pluralistic community, you have to understand that everyone is different and one of the best ways to see that is by exploring the world around you._\\n>\\n> _My previous roles before joining Akash have also helped me develop my understanding of people. I\u2019ve sponsored events in Shanghai. I\u2019ve hosted meetups in Tel Aviv, and I\u2019ve managed community ambassadors from Guatemala, Canada, and Australia to name a few. The more I connected with people, the more I learned how to become a better community manager._\\n\\n#### **Community as a Strategic Advantage**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nBuilding and growing the passionate and devoted Ethereum community has taught Adam that Community is a strategic advantage.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\n> _A million users pay for your product because you\u2019re solving a problem for them. But let\u2019s say a better product comes along at a lower cost. Those million users will happily jump ship. Whereas, 1,000 community members who not only get their problem solved by your product, but also receive intrinsic value from being a member of a community will stay, and defend you._\\n>\\n> *Passionate and engaged community members will not leave your product for just any other product that crosses their path.*&nbsp;  \\n> You can see this inside of the Ethereum community. Ethereum has some scaling issues that have been well documented. Many of those issues are being resolved in L2 and ETH2 solutions--think EIP 1559.\\n>\\n> _When newer blockchains have come along, why didn\u2019t the ETH community jump ship? Sure, partially it\u2019s because they believe in the future of ETH, but I\u2019d argue that the community built around ETH has given them something more, something besides the tech--a sense or purpose and belonging that other chains haven\u2019t._\\n>\\n> _TLDR; The more you as a company or project involve yourself in your community, the more ownership community members feel about your products._\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620927067-3uhwvfvuohfur7hjzfs6emosks7kuwnjptlse71kdzksip959a9wncjn0wlighzl7zfxparz7savkcgqetf0uj7kzzduwm0g5ehhtm9ksms6khvzeujysv6fmro6qbz5rgrp.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **On Joining The Unstoppable Cloud**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nHaving joined ConsenSys in late 2017, Adam witnessed the incredible developments, as well as the hype, excitement, and cash grabs of that period in crypto.\\n\\n> _I witnessed projects that were straight up cash grabs. Hey Bitconnect, not cool bro!_\\n>\\n> _I bring this up because when I was first approached by Akash, without first reading the whitepaper, my mind went immediately to, \u201chere we go, another pie in the sky project!_\\n\\nSo how did we convince Adam to join?\\n\\n> _Once I dug deeper, I found a project that is very real, and a team that is even more real! A marketplace for cloud compute is interesting by itself, but with crypto economic incentives, you have unique and powerful motivation for leaving traditional cloud providers. I feel like I\u2019m joining a rocketship that\u2019s about to lift off._\\n\\n#### **Presence as a Driver of Community Building**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThere\u2019s no magic bullet for building a great community, but over ten years of learning, Adam has found that all successful community professionals are present.\\n\\n> _Being present means multiple things\u2014it means:_\\n>\\n> \u2022 _following through on your promises_  \\n> \u2022 _supporting the community through difficult times_  \\n> \u2022 _listening to the needs of members_  \\n> \u2022 _providing experiences that are memorable_\\n>\\n> _The more involved and the more present you are in a community, the more present other community members will choose to be._\\n>\\n> _When I look at great community teams, the ones that stand out are the ones that treat themselves as just another member of the community. They get just as excited about a new product launch or a product feature as the rest of the community does._\\n>\\n> _When community teams treat their community members as friends and not just users, that\u2019s when magic can happen._\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620927075-mbm1ndwkt0motpuarodekh20wijangh9lasyhqq7baaebkl2h8fb1nloo3fly4uyrttzbwn2eyr4k2hvunyaetyheqaw79pofnloxlvje9t7ocy4voik1kkp8vczce99ncngef.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Scaling The Unstoppable Cloud Global Community**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nA big function of Adam\u2019s role will be to listen and to get community feedback. Gregarious and a born connector, Adam is most excited about the opportunity to do this by traveling to engage community members in person, and not just virtually.\\n\\nHe\u2019s also excited about enabling developers more freedom and flexibility to build. How will he know that we\u2019re successful?\\n\\n> _There are two things that feed off of each other in a company's growth--community health metrics and company health metrics. Community health metrics are number of active community members, number of RSVPs to an event, or community engagement numbers like message volume, for example._\\n>\\n> _Company health metrics are numbers of active users, number of new users or number of retained users. My aim is to provide SMART community goals that ladder up to business goals. SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely._\\n\\n#### **Staying Unstoppable Outside of Work**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nHealthy body, healthy mind. Adam definitely espouses this ethos, biking around New York City at least four times a week and indoor climbing three to four times a week.\\n\\n> _Climbing is great.

We\u2019ll democratize the acquisition of compute by offering developers unprecedented choice--not only in where they deploy and how fast they\u2019ll be able to&nbsp;deploy, but also at a price they want to pay.\\n\\nOur goal is to change the power dynamics and put developers in control (self-sovereign).\\n\\nWe update frequently as we progress the platform. You can always check the [releases](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases) page in our GitHub repo for the latest enhancements and fixes.\\n\\n**NETWORK USAGE**\\n\\nThe most important KPI that we\u2019re monitoring is _Active Leases - Daily, Monthly_ (DAL/MAL).\\n\\nThis indicates new deployments per day. Note: deployments can be _active_ for more than 1 day. The day after our launch, we had 3 DAL and are now averaging 50.\\n\\nThere are a few other KPIs that we are tracking. We\u2019ll soon have a network stats page that will show the relevant KPIs that indicate network usage and growth.\\n\\n**IMPROVED UX FOR TENANTS**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve made several improvements to our Command Line Interface (CLI) for developers to make deploying faster and more streamlined.\\n\\n- [#1165](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1165) - changed default to query for all provider attributes if no arguments are provided. Makes it faster to vouch for the provider via signing for all attributes at once\\n\\n- [#1153](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1153) - improved error reporting\\n\\n- [#1187](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1187) - improved support for hardware wallets (e.g. [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison))\\n\\n- [#1151](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1151) - output and error messages stream to stdout/stderr\\n\\n- [#1149](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1149) - improved output messages when using option flags. Default is scoped to option flags\\n\\n**SAFETY NET FEATURE**\\n\\nWe recently added a safety net for Tenants. If a manifest is not sent to a provider within some period of time after a lease is created, the provider will close the lease. This safety net prevents tenants from paying for leases that do not have any workloads running.\\n\\n**PROVIDER PRICING**\\n\\n[Pricing Update](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1173): To account for Akash Token\u2019s (AKT) rising prices, providers will need a way to offer lower bids than the current minimum of 1 uAKT, or 0.000001 AKT. Included in this update is the first step towards implementing fractional uAKT pricing, and involves switching the pricing variables from integer type to decimal type.\\n\\nUltimately, providers will be able to structure their pricing in such a way that they may earn 0.25 uAKT per block and be able to withdraw 1 uAKT every four blocks.\\n\\n_In the future, we will support fractional uAKT._\\n\\n**IMPROVED NETWORK PERFORMANCE**\\n\\nWe now preemptively stop broadcasting so that as more providers come online, invalid transactions will not affect network performance. Providers only bid on deployments that attributes have been audited for, and have the correct signature. [This](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1162) determines which provider is allowed to bid, in order.\\n\\nThis reduces the network congestion on the blockchain for improved performance, and enables pre-filtering of acceptable matches. An additional filter has been added that enables providers to not bid on groups where the calculated price is too high ([#1147](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1147)).\\n\\n**CLIENT CERTIFICATES AUTO CREATE**\\n\\n[Client Certificates Check](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1169): To establish secure connections between Tenants and Providers on Akash, an mTLS certificate must be created and stored on-chain. If the certificate was not created, and a Tenant tried to use the deploy tool to create a deployment, the process would fail and the user\u2019s transaction fee would be wasted.\\n\\nThis fix now requires a certificate file to be present and on-chain before the transaction is broadcast to the network. It will auto-create if one doesn\u2019t exist.\\n\\n**ECOSYSTEM**\\n\\n- Security improvements to the ecosystem: [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1171) and [Tendermint](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1202).\\n\\n- [Reliability improvement](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1193) _-_ This improves the reliability of the transaction written to the blockchain. Today, the transaction has a 10 second timeout. At times, it can take longer for approval by enough validators. We ensure that this timeout doesn\u2019t result in an error. We now auto-retry to check if the transaction is recorded, enabling the deployment workflow.\\n\\n- IBC is now live! - InterBlockchain Communication protocol enables interoperability between multiple blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. We\u2019re one of the core contributors to the Cosmos and Tendermint open-source projects.&nbsp; As core developers of the IBC relayer, we\u2019re excited to announce that IBC is now live on Akash. With IBC, Akash enables ATOM to AKT swap via Cosmos HUB, and multi-currency settlement, thus enhancing liquidity.\\n\\n**UPDATED FAQ**\\n\\nWe started consolidating developer questions into an [FAQ](https://akash.network/docs/documentation/faq) and will continue to expand this resource.\\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss the Latest MAINNET 2, Akash, and AKT News!**\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n[**Join our Telegram**](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest news, giveaways, and invites to special events!\\n\\n[**Join our Discord developer chat**](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67) for technical support and information.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash MAINNET 2 Update: April 29, 2021&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash MAINNET 2 v0.10.1 launched on March 8th, and since then, we\u2019ve seen an exciting diversity of apps deployed on Akash, and we\u2019ll be sharing many of these pioneering use cases in the coming weeks.

For perspective, Minecraft is the fifth most played game in the world with 126 million current users, and _now, all its users can play Minecraft on Akash_.\\n\\nThis is significant for many reasons. First, running Minecraft on Akash means countless other games can run on the network as well. Secondly, we are positioned to unlock the benefits of Akash to a massive and entirely new user base, including developers, gamers, and businesses.\\n\\n#### **Minecraft in the World\u2019s First Open-Source Cloud**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925257-2021-04-2316-48-54-1024x640.png)\\n\\nIn collaboration with the MothRuby community, we will be running a scavenger hunt for 1000 AKT in the world\u2019s first Minecraft server hosted on Akash. Akashcraft will be the first scavenger hunt ever for a cryptocurrency in a Minecraft server hosted on a decentralized cloud. Yes, this is _extremely_ meta. Yes, you should be excited for this historic event.\\n\\nAkashcraft lies at the intersection of blockchain, gaming, and cloud. With over 3.42 billion gamers and counting, gaming has become one of the biggest industries in the world. Advances in mobile gaming, edge computing and cloud technology are moving gaming to the cloud, and Akash is poised to support the growing cloud gaming industry.\\n\\n#### **What is MothRuby?**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925359-mothwoobie-1024x760.png)\\n\\nMothRuby is a gaming community focused on the integration of&nbsp; Akash Network and gaming. Members of MothRuby aim to bring existing game server hosting onto Akash to leverage the cost savings and decentralized benefits of hosted applications on the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud. MothRuby also aims to build out entirely new games on Akash.\\n\\nFor the first event, MothRuby is partnering with Akash Network to host the first Minecraft world on the decentralized cloud: **Akashcraft**!\\n\\nBe on the lookout for a tutorial series on how to accomplish your own version of Akashcraft on Akash.

Castles, nearby farm buildings, lookout towers along roads - all hold AKT rewards, as well as anywhere on the surface within city walls (meaning you probably won't find any AKT in a far-away desert). Chests may also contain weapons, items, or potions that will help you out in the server--just because you found a chest does not guarantee there will be AKT inside!\\n\\nAny chest that contains AKT will be located next to a player-specific [Ender Chest](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ender_Chest). The contents of Ender Chests can only be viewed by you, so any loot or AKT you find can be placed in an Ender Chest (a darker color than usual chests) to be reclaimed upon death.\\n\\nIf you are standing in the Spawn location that contains the Akash Network logo, you will not be able to attack or be attacked by other players; however, the rest of the world will have player-versus-player (PvP) enabled for high stakes!\\n\\n\\\\*You may succumb to death from mobs and other players, and will drop your whole inventory on death, so make sure you take precautions to prepare yourself for combat.\\n\\n#### **Before the Akashcraft Event**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nPrior to the event, it would be wise to create your main AKT wallet.

During the event, you might be tempted to immediately import your recently discovered AKT funds to your main wallet for maximum safety, _but this distraction could put your character in danger!_\\n\\nIf you choose to store them for later, you might risk having the AKT pillaged by other players on the server. Navigating these choices is part of what makes the stakes of this event so high!\\n\\n#### **Akashcraft Server Rules**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nModerators will be present during the scavenger hunt to ensure that both the Discord and Minecraft environments remain free of unpleasantries. **Please do not** spam chats or engage in distasteful remarks while chatting on MothRuby servers.\\n\\nFor any other questions on server rules or details, hop on over to the [MothRuby discord server](https://discord.gg/ADf5XfnR8T) where a moderator will be happy to assist.\\n\\n#### **Akashcraft Livestream**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925375-akashcraftlivestream-twitter-1024x576.png)\\n\\nJoin Akash Senior Marketing Manager [Michael Gushansky](https://akash.network/blog/introducing-michael-gushansky/) and [Crypto Moth](https://twitter.com/JustaCryptoMoth) for a special livestream event Friday 4/30 6PM PST.

As the blockchain industry continues to thrive and our team grows, we began to serve enterprise-level clients and KOLs, apart from common users.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThat\u2019s when we recognized the value of the blockchain infrastructure and decided to develop ourselves into a professional and all-around infrastructure service provider, creating true value while safeguarding the security of proof-of-stake (PoS) backed blockchains by way of node operation.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWe\u2019ve joined several high-quality PoS-backed projects and partnered with many enterprises and institutions in terms of security, asset management, and trading. With the help of our extensive industry resources, we\u2019ve developed a diverse array of businesses, including node operation, delegation service, node set-up guide, and dedicated tools and products for different projects.&nbsp;  \\n  \\n\\n**HashQuark supports all mainstream Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. Why is supporting PoS blockchains important to the company versus Proof of Work (PoW)?**  \\n\\nWe\u2019ve thought highly of the PoS blockchain even before our official launch for a few reasons:&nbsp;\\n\\n1\\\\. We believe that blockchain will create a distributed business counterpart parallel to the physical one. However, for the moment it is widely accepted that most PoW blockchains do poorly in performance and are less friendly to common users; it\u2019s undoubtedly a major barrier to mass adoption and the promotion of use cases in the commercial field. The PoS-like consensus mechanisms, by contrast, do better in all the above aspects.  \\n\\n2\\\\. PoS now represents the general trend in the world of blockchain, as evidenced by the launch of so many high-quality projects such as ETH2.0, Polkadot, Cardano, and Akash.&nbsp;  \\n\\n3\\\\. The staking economy still has a lot to discover and develop, and we\u2019re excited to witness and grow with the promising industry as things are just beginning to take off. Staking, as a critical component of the DeFi system, will inevitably continue to develop with the prosperity of DeFi, and that\u2019s also why we have always thought highly of its future.  \\n  \\n\\n**HashQuark currently supports Eth 2.0, Binance, Polkadot, Cardano among other networks. How do you select what projects to partner with, and what attracted you to work with Akash Network?**&nbsp;  \\n\\nThere are three aspects we look at when evaluating a project:  \\n\\n1\\\\. Mainnet Launch: we prefer a PoS project that has launched to mainnet because it means it is technologically mature and that block producers and delegators can take part in the staking process.  \\n\\n2\\\\. DApps: we look to see if DApps are running on top of its distributed system. That\u2019s partly because we believe that the staking economy means more than staking services alone. Decentralized applications help constitute real successful and scalable blockchain projects.  \\n\\n3\\\\. Community: Lastly, we look for a well-developed community. Consensus among the community is what we believe matters in the staking economy\u2014or rather, in the blockchain industry.  \\n\\nWe were amazed by the concept of Akash\u2019s decentralized open-source cloud and recognized the significance and need for a DeCloud in the entire blockchain industry. Akash is lower-cost, more effective, and flexible, and HashQuark has expertise in blockchain infrastructure, a solid foundation for the decentralized cloud. We believe our partnership will help provide cloud services in a more decentralized manner.  \\n  \\n\\n**What blockchain/crypto sectors or types of projects are you currently excited about, and why?**  \\n\\nWe are currently interested in the now popular sectors of DeFi and NFT projects, both of which are great applications of blockchain and have attracted some traditional institutions.  \\n  \\n\\n**How do you envision blockchain changing the world?**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen an overwhelming digital/virtual tendency over our real, physical lives, especially after the year 2020. There\u2019s no doubt that in a more digital, _fiction-like_ world, identity is something not to miss, and only with a blockchain-based value Internet is there a real possibility of such a system.\\n\\nA few years ago, the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2025, 10% of the world\u2019s assets will be based on the blockchain. That\u2019s also what we envision in the future of the world when it comes to blockchain.  \\n  \\n\\n**If you had the opportunity to give advice to your younger self as you start venturing into the world of blockchain, what would it be?**  \\n\\nAlways have faith in the blockchain and Bitcoin.  \\n  \\n\\n**How can people get started earning rewards/staking AKT today?**&nbsp;  \\n\\nThere are generally two ways: delegation and node operation. But for most common players with limited access to relevant resources and technical know-how, we suggest the former one.&nbsp;  \\n  \\n\\n#### **Get the Latest Akash and AKT Token News and Giveaways!**\\n\\n[Join the Unstoppable Cloud](https://t.me/AkashNW)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network Partners with HashQuark, the World's Largest Staking+ Service Provider&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We\u2019re excited to announce a partnership with HashQuark, the largest Asian staking company and one of the world\u2019s largest validators.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Kelsey Ruiz&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.TyCUBp_w.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1600],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-network-partners-with-hashquark-the-worlds-largest-staking-service-provider/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;wen-marketing-growing-the-first-open-source-cloud/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;wen-marketing-growing-the-first-open-source-cloud&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;  \\nWen Marketing?  \\n\\nFor me it started at the age of 7. After escaping landmines in the jungle of Cambodia, I had my first marketing role ever--convincing Khmer Rouge soldiers to let us cross the border to Thailand, and to the beginning of freedom.&nbsp;  \\n\\nMy path to Akash Network, and to the decentralized future of the cloud, was not a linear one. I\u2019m drawn to audacious challenges and transformative solutions that improve human experience.\\n\\n#### **From Star Wars, to 3D Printed Rockets, to DeCloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nOver the past 18 years, I\u2019ve helped materialize ideas and solutions that have never existed before, at companies including [Relativity](https://www.relativityspace.com/), [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/l/sell-tickets/?&amp;mkwid=s_dc&amp;pcrid=436502086719&amp;pkw=eventbrite&amp;pmt=e&amp;plc=&amp;_bk=eventbrite&amp;_bt=436502086719&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwpdqDBhCSARIsAEUJ0hPwXBhdbyDhJv4tXf-dtWR5B46bNjCg8wPZQAIiqnG1w4IEZuCCrpkaAoOUEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds), [AdRoll](https://www.adroll.com/), [Lucasfilm](https://www.lucasfilm.com/) / [Disney](https://www.disney.com/), [Square Enix](https://square-enix-games.com/en_US/home), [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/), and [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/). I\u2019ve developed and launched top 10 selling Star Wars, Tomb Raider, and Nintendo products.  \\n\\nIn the last 10 years, I\u2019ve helped founders realize their visions--the bigger, the better, and grown three early-stage startups to profitability and unicorn status ($1+ billion market cap).  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925203-106734073-1602081721357-relativityspacetemplar-1024x576.jpeg)\\n\\n_Relativity_\\n\\nI met Akash Network\u2019s CEO, Greg Osuri when I was still at Relativity helping build humanity\u2019s multi-planetary future with robots, 3D printing, and rockets. Coming from a country devastated by authoritarian control, Greg\u2019s vision of a permissionless, self-sovereign, censorship-resistant, and decentralized open-source cloud deeply resonated with me.  \\n\\nAs more of our work and play continues to move online, an open-source cloud is critical for increasing access, freedom, privacy, and sovereignty for builders of the Internet, and empowers people around the world with control over their online future.  \\n\\nIn my 20 years in Silicon Valley, Akash was one of the few companies I\u2019d encountered that leveraged blockchain to solve a problem that almost all organizations faced--the ability to grow and scale, fast.&nbsp;  \\n\\nInspired by Akash\u2019s potential to transform the next generation of the Internet, I joined first as an Advisor, and after helping Relativity raise its Series C, I joined full-time as Chief Growth Officer to help build the world\u2019s first open-source cloud, and to drive global awareness, engagement, and growth.\\n\\n#### **Bootstrapping Growth for the World\u2019s First Decentralized Cloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926937-23stqj0p0um-ilyah9mapnm5csdaqwxyfkus3oxg6sh04y1brpw6z4np8ilro6onmtlmyw20k73sfwmvb76vbx3tolbsztklhpegest3vipd-gjvvgh2zgj3vpbhjuxdwjn0bim.jpeg)\\n\\nIn October 2019 when I joined, I was fortunate to convince Michael Gushansky to join me as Marketing and Community Manager. Coming from music, events, and auto industries, Michael\u2019s extensive capabilities in online and offline community building, and his award-winning work in Sales and Customer Service in startup environments convinced me that he would thrive at our (then scrappy) enterprise.  \\n\\nA little known fun fact is that Michael happens to be a renowned DJ, and both of us are also music and event promoters in California, which is how we first met.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAs a tiny but mighty Growth team of two, with limited resources and no budget, we had no time or money to waste. We couldn\u2019t afford to make many mistakes. We studied similar projects and startups that had both failed and succeeded. We canvassed their channels and their content, tracked the tone and message volume of their social media, and then we experimented.&nbsp;  \\n\\nI brought best practices from over 18 years of building some of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, and we leveraged the four pillars I\u2019d leaned on to bootstrap my previous startups to hyper-growth and profitability--Content, Community, Campaigns, and Communications.\\n\\n  \\n**CONTENT**  \\n\\nContent is the fuel for marketing and community efforts. Relevant and valuable content delivered through multiple channels is the foundation for acquisition and retention efforts, especially with the dramatic shift in the buying process and attention economy.  \\n\\n*   94% use online research in their purchase journey\\n    \\n*   3x more traffic to B2B websites with 11+ blogs/month\\n    \\n*   67% complete buy process prior to brand engagement\\n    \\n\\nWhy is content at the core of my growth strategy? Content optimizes online channels so the right prospects find us, increases brand awareness and preference, influences purchase path and decision, and generates quality leads for less money. I also noticed that most of our analogues in crypto didn\u2019t invest in content, and realized it had the additional benefit of differentiating us from other projects.  \\n\\nInstrumental to our content efforts is Creative Content Manager and Visual Designer Olive Kimoto, a creative polymath who joined us last May.&nbsp;  \\n\\nIn addition to product, partnership, exchange, and team announcements, we also feature topics across cloud, crypto, and the future of dWeb. We\u2019ll continue to expand our global content and cadence while leveraging content marketing and SEO best practices.\\n\\n  \\n**COMMUNITY**  \\n\\nA healthy, supportive, and self-sustaining global community is essential to the success of Akash. Over the past year (in one of his three full-time roles at Akash), Michael has successfully led a dedicated global community team to build one of the largest communities in the Cosmos ecosystem.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThis past year, we expanded our global community to China with the help of our Chinese Community Manager and OG Group co-founder Alex Wang, and to Russia with the dedicated efforts of our Russian Community Manager Andrew Hnatiuk, and now, Korea.  \\n\\nThe foundation of our community growth is an exceptional member experience, content, and cadence.\\n\\n  \\n**CAMPAIGNS**  \\n\\nIntegrating campaigns across content, community, communications, and acquisition marketing enabled us to exceed key Growth metrics for Akash\u2019s utility token, AKT,&nbsp;and for Akash DeCloud. The weekly cadence of our campaigns enabled us to grow exponentially, as each channel was maximized to reinforce and strengthen our brand and positioning.  \\n\\nOur biweekly content and community promotions, as well as our Supermini pre-order campaign last year, allowed us to test and optimize across new channels. In the coming months, Michael will be focused on scaling our Growth Marketing funnel.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922422-akashsuperminifrontside-1024x576.jpg)\\n\\n  \\n**COMMUNICATIONS**  \\n\\nAs the fourth Growth pillar, communications encompasses thought leadership, public relations, analyst relations, events, and influencer marketing. I've helped take early stage startups to growth stage and unicorn status with communications as a key driver--it's a growth multiplier when done right.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAfter a long search, we were thrilled to have Kelsey Ruiz join the Dream Team as Head of Communications this past quarter. An award-winning Communications specialist with extensive experience building large developer communities, Kelsey previously directed communications at Ethereum Classic Labs, Leaf Group, and AngelHack, where she managed 50+ events and hackathons globally for a community of 175,000 developers.  \\n\\nKelsey will develop and run online and offline content and communications programs that will inspire and engage global audiences with our vision. She'll help drive brand and product awareness and engagement among journalists, influencers, and developers.\\n\\n#### **2020 Growth Results**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nIn only one year, we launched and promoted 4 successful testnets, including the three phases of The Akashian Challenge, and the historic MVP of the world\u2019s first open-source cloud, Akash MAINNET 2.  \\n\\nWe worked with CEO, Greg Osuri to develop specs for the Akash Supermini portable supercomputer, and progressed the design with creative duo Guillermo Sanchez del Corral and Rafael Saenz of debuti, and industrial designer Sungbum Park.&nbsp;  \\n\\nIn the second half of this year, we announced partnerships with Solana, Kava, Cosmos, Tendermint, Interchain Foundation, Chainlink, and Equinix Metal, the largest data center provider in the world. We also announced five exchange partnerships starting with BitMax (now AscendEx), with Gate.io as our latest listing partner.  \\n\\nAdditional Growth Results:\\n\\n*   In the past 52 weeks, we\u2019ve launched **111 blog articles**\\\\--about 2+ articles a week.\\n    \\n*   Grew Twitter from **800 to 28,000 followers** and counting\\n    \\n*   Grew Telegram from **1,000 to 14,400 members**\\\\--one of the largest in the Cosmos ecosystem\\n    \\n*   Produced **3 Chinese Community Summits with 4,000+ attendees each**\\n    \\n*   Established Akash Russian Telegram, **the largest in the Cosmos Ecosystem**\\n    \\n*   Produced over **70 global AMAs/Interviews**\\n    \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925368-team3-1024x706.png)\\n\\n#### **Growth in Q2 2021**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nNow that Akash MAINNET 2 has launched, our team will be focused on the following objectives for the next quarter:\\n\\n1.  Accelerate global awareness of Akash DeCloud and Akash Token (AKT)\\n    \\n2.  Drive product adoption among developers and organizations in the decentralized ecosystem\\n    \\n3.

Despite this, the migration of our work and life to the cloud, hastened by the pandemic this past year, continues inexorably.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAs cloud and Big Tech become more centralized and consolidated, our team is even more committed to building the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud, and the first viable alternative to centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.  \\n\\nIn Q1 2021, we launched Akash MAINNET 2, the MVP of the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud. MAINNET 2 integrates five years of development, and learnings from four of the ecosystem\u2019s most ambitious testnets. Akash MAINNET 2 became one of the first platforms to launch on Cosmos\u2019s Stargate upgrade, integrated with Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), ushering in the beginnings of interoperability for the ecosystem.  \\n\\nWe progressed our development of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Relayer, an essential component to unlocking IBC\u2019s features.  \\n\\nWe also announced an integration with Equinix Metal, the largest data center provider in the world, and a surprise listing on Gate.io, our fifth exchange listing.  \\n\\nFrom our development of the IBC Relayer, to the Equinix Metal integration, to the launch of MAINNET 2, Akash accelerated critical milestones across product, partnerships, and people in Q1 2021.  \\n\\n**PRODUCT**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n----------------------------\\n\\n#### **Akash MAINNET 2 Launch**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925257-mainnet-banner-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nIn early March, we announced the historic MVP launch of Akash MAINNET 2, the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud.  \\n\\nMAINNET 2 Quick Stats:  \\n\\n*   The first deployment on Akash DeCloud was the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](http://7nd4hr8cepabrdvaldd1r4uf04.ingress.sjc1p0.mainnet.akashian.io/)\\n    \\n*   746 Application Deployments since launch\\n    \\n*   Up to 8x cost savings versus Amazon Web Services (AWS), being realized\\n    \\n\\nAkash MAINNET 2 is the culmination of five years of development and four of the ecosystem\u2019s most ambitious testnets, including Phase 3 of The Akashian Challenge, where we saw over 460 developers from around the world (second highest number of participants after Ethereum\u2019s testnet) deploy 3600+ applications on the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud.  \\n\\nAs the first open-source cloud and the only viable decentralized cloud alternative to centralized cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, Akash MAINNET 2 empowers developers to break free from the limitations of traditional cloud infrastructure.  \\n\\n[**Learn More**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-launches-akash-mainnet-2-the-first-decentralized-open-source-cloud/)  \\n  \\n\\n####   \\n**Akash Network Develops Critical IBC Relayer**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925348-ibc-banner-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nIn development for over three years, IBC is the flagship feature of the Cosmos Network. For crypto and blockchain, where interoperability and composability are essential to continued growth for decentralized sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), IBC is the most promising production ready solution.\\n\\nIBC enables different blockchain protocols to communicate and transact with each other independently, providing a framework to connect the global economy to the blockchain. Participants on existing blockchains will be able to interact and exchange with each other across chains.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe ability for chains to transact and interoperate will be transformational for the industry.\\n\\nThe ICF awarded Akash with a grant to build and maintain the IBC Relayer. Essential to launching the IBC protocol and the only way users will be able to use IBC, the Relayer is the user interface that enables all transfers and transactions on IBC.\\n\\nWe migrated and developed features from Cosmos\u2019s Game of Zones, Cosmos\u2019s proof-of-concept testnet, to a production ready IBC-compatible Relayer.\\n\\n[**Learn More**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-develops-critical-ibc-relayer-for-inter-blockchain-communication-protocol/)\\n\\n  \\n**PARTNERSHIPS**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n#### **Akash Network Integrates with Equinix Metal**  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925374-equinix-banner-1-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nWe announced that Akash Network is integrating with Equinix Metal and enabling developers and companies to decentralize their cloud infrastructure through Akash MAINNET 2.  \\n\\nEquinix is the world's largest data center and colocation infrastructure provider, with 220 data centers in 25 countries.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThrough Equinix Metal, Equinix\u2019s on-demand and interconnected bare metal service, we\u2019ll be able to provide developers, companies, and projects across the blockchain ecosystem with a faster, more efficient, and lower-cost decentralized cloud alternative, with nearly unlimited use cases.&nbsp;  \\n\\nTo start, Akash Network will enable a vibrant and growing, interconnected, and interoperable Cosmos ecosystem, beginning with non-critical workloads and eventually full nodes, to run on a decentralized high-performance non-custodial cloud at a lower cost.  \\n\\n[**Learn More**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-integrates-with-equinix-metal-to-provide-the-first-viable-decentralized-cloud-solution/)  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n#### **AKT Token On Gate.io**  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926938-gateio-live-2-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nWith the launch of MAINNET 2, we saw even more interest and demand for Akash and AKT.

I was close to the team as it was being built, and that became my gateway drug into dWeb.**\\n\\nChjango graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the University of California, San Diego where she credits her university experience and mathematical background with the capacity to understand abstract concepts in crypto.\\n\\nChjango first got involved in Bitcoin and started seriously researching its capabilities and potential in 2014, which inevitably led her to the blockchain. In 2017, the ICO era, she realized there wasn\u2019t just a Cambrian explosion of dApps, but of narratives. There were decentralized gaming, collectibles, IoT, GPS, exchanges, identity, storage, VMs, and more. By present-day, most of those narratives had lost steam, and the projects that pushed those narratives died along with the end of the bull market.\\n\\nAt that point, Handshake was being developed and she got close to the team as it was being built, which reeled her into the potential for dWeb. Chjango is currently a Director of the dWeb Foundation and advises cryptocurrency projects focused on solving some of the biggest problems in centralized technology.\\n\\n#### **Bullish on the Possibilities of Decentralized Web**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n> **The reason I\u2019m so bullish about dWeb is because the very projects that are needed to enable this vision to come to life are the ones that subsisted through the 2018-2019 bear market.**\\n\\nChjango believes decentralizing every piece of Internet infrastructure from top to bottom will be essential to the growth of Web 2.0 and dWeb.\\n\\n> We have Handshake as the uncensorable identity layer (i.e. your domain name as your online identity or social handle), Akash for decentralized cloud, Orchid and Sentinel for decentralized bandwidth, Sia, IPFS, and Footnote for every flavor of decentralized storage you can imagine, and what you get as a result of leveraging those components is a website or application that is censorship-resistant at every layer of Web 3.0.\\n\\n> Akash is the first and only project in the Cosmos ecosystem that is solving decentralized cloud computing. I only came around to seeing this as an important problem to solve when I watched what happened with Parler, where the Big 5 tech oligopoly fell like dominos to shut down Parler from its social media handle on Twitter and Facebook, to the Apple and Google app stores, and even down to its servers on AWS. That was the wake-up moment for me, which instructed me to pay closer attention to projects like Akash.\\n\\nOn top of that are integrations for cryptocurrency payments and DeFi--enabling a new yet familiar Internet with its own \u201cunbanking\u201d system. The next generation of Internet users may never even need a bank account.\\n\\n> Imagine browsing the dWeb with the same experience you have going online today, doing some grocery shopping, paying in crypto, and receiving your groceries without ever having to cash out in fiat and never needing a credit card and being part of a credit system again. That\u2019s the evolution of blockchain technology and where this is all going.\\n\\n> The train doesn\u2019t stop at DeFi or NFTs. We\u2019re headed for destination dWeb. That\u2019s kind of awesome to think about.\\n\\nWhen asked how she thinks Stargate and IBC will accelerate the decentralized ecosystem, Chjango reinforced that with IBC, builders finally have a good solution for composing their appchains in a manner that\u2019s more secure and censorship-resistant. The fact that IBC will ultimately accelerate blockchain interoperability standardization makes her bullish about seeing the different ways of allowing chains to talk to one another, converging on a single, standardized, and elegant design.\\n\\n#### **Highlighting Emerging and Anti-Censorship Technologies**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAs the host of Interchain, Chjango covers cutting edge, emerging tech and more specifically, anti-censorship technologies. Every episode and guest offers each of their unique insights from vastly different worldviews, and she finds that each episode offers distinctive value, which is precisely the goal for her podcast.\\n\\nShe enjoys sourcing guests who are hidden gems in the cryptosphere, or projects that haven\u2019t become too mainstream yet. Helping people discover these projects before they get priced in by the market, is where most of the fun is for her.\\n\\nAs she gears up to interview our CEO, Greg Osuri today, **April 8th at noon PST**, she notes that Greg demonstrated himself as a thought leader speaking on behalf of the decentralized web, by speaking at Handycon, a Handshake conference the dWeb Foundation and Sky Include hosted together (see the full talk, [here](https://youtu.be/TB-IpeTQYsk)) and when he tweeted about the Pancake Swap and Cream Finance DNS hacks.\\n\\n> What people who are currently bullish about DeFi and NFTs are missing is that last connecting dot about dWeb. dWeb is the clear next iteration where blockchain tech is heading in the next 36 months, and it\u2019s not that it\u2019ll be mutually exclusive, but rather, it\u2019ll be additive.\\n\\nJust as after 2017, when the ICO narrative fizzled out, Chjango noticed in its wake, interoperability, DeFi and NFT narratives emerging to take center stage.\\n\\n> **The same shift will happen as the market moves to realize the not-yet-obvious next step. And if you take nothing else away from this interview with Greg on April 8th, my hope is that you take away the realization that dWeb is the next narrative. And if it\u2019s not obvious, it will become obvious within the next 18 months.**\\n\\nTune in today **Thursday, April 8th at noon PST** to hear more from Chjango Unchained and our CEO, Greg Osuri, as they discuss the future of dWeb and how Akash Network fulfills a foundational aspect of the complete decentralized stack.\\n\\n[Tune in here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xlOVeUXd90)\\n\\n####\\n\\n**Don\u2019t Miss the Latest Akash and AKT News!**\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n[Join our Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW)&nbsp;for the latest news, giveaways, and invites to special events!\\n\\nJoin our&nbsp;[Discord developer chat](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67)&nbsp;for technical support and information.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;A Vision of the Decentralized Web with Chjango Unchained&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The train doesn\u2019t stop at DeFi or NFTs.

The global community reception has been encouragingly positive, and we\u2019ve been grateful for the pioneering developers who have deployed on the platform, and continue to help us improve the product experience.\\n\\nStarting with the Founders Challenge testnet in Q4 2019, then the three phases of The Akashian Challenge testnets through 2020, our approach to developing the platform has&nbsp; been focused on iterative development, refinement, and on user feedback.\\n\\n**It was this investment in early and fast learnings that enabled us to conduct a very smooth MAINNET 2 launch in under two hours.** This was an incredible feat for a decentralized network consisting of multiple stakeholder groups and individuals located across the globe. Our community of 64 validators synchronized efforts to stop the chain, and worked through the process for upgrading the chain to the new software.\\n\\nAs new blocks were produced, Akash MAINNET 2 came online! Over the week following launch, we began seeing more deployments and usage on the network. It\u2019s been incredible to see what started from a vision to a live network with deployments.\\n\\nWe\u2019re just starting to see the realization of Akash\u2019s vision of a permissionless, sovereign, and open cloud, enabling builders and companies more freedom and flexibility to create, and to scale.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have exciting updates and use case studies for developers and organizations deploying on the platform.\\n\\nCheck out the MAINNET 2 progress summary below covering the two weeks since launch.\\n\\nMAINNET 2 Launch Quick Stats:\\n\\n- The first deployment on Akash DeCloud was the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](http://7nd4hr8cepabrdvaldd1r4uf04.ingress.sjc1p0.mainnet.akashian.io/)\\n\\n- 234 Applications Deployed (with 25 active)\\n\\n- 57 Developers\\n\\n- 8x cost savings versus Amazon Web Services (AWS), being realized by a number of users\\n\\n#### **MAINNET 2 Development Update**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**PROVIDER FIXES**\\n\\nPricing [Update](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1173): To account for AKT token\u2019s rising prices, providers will need a way to offer lower bids than the current minimum of 1 uAKT, or 0.000001 AKT. Included in this update is the first step towards implementing fractional uAKT pricing, and involves switching the pricing variables from integer type to decimal type. Ultimately, providers will be able to structure their pricing in such a way that they may earn 0.25 uAKT per block and be able to withdraw 1 uAKT every four blocks.\\n\\n**DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**\\n\\nWhen the network upgrade first went live, we directed tenants to use the Deploy Tool, which was meant to simplify the deployment process and provide a quick method to deploy applications. The tool integrates a number of steps necessary for deploying on Akash, and returns a URI hostname used to access the application.\\n\\nAs it turned out, many users were having issues with the tool. If one of the intermediate steps failed, for example, the tool would return an error message and exit. The user would fix the cause of error, and run the tool again, but it would restart from the beginning--at times causing new errors as the first steps had already been completed once before.\\n\\nTo remedy this, the [primary documentation](https://akash.network/docs/guides/deploy) for deploying an application now details every step of the process, and provides additional context and clarity for users. We\u2019re already receiving good feedback for this new process, as it gives users a better understanding of what is happening when they deploy their applications.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925200-n1tzov9msniedx0-wv-4opunrhmdgcfbbuunzdekzftogbinlimot0oaw2l5wdlg9kd3edpnmaj3ml7o8mi8kgaiagpncwvg1zy3uv0mwizjffuyr2q1hqhx3rco9cigssohnfs.png)\\n\\n**CLIENT CERTIFICATES CHECK**\\n\\n[Client Certificates Check](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1169): To establish secure connections between Tenants and Providers on Akash, an mTLS certificate must be created and stored on-chain. If the certificate was not created, and a Tenant tried to use the deploy tool to create a deployment, the process would fail and the user\u2019s transaction fee would be wasted. This fix now requires a certificate file to be present and on-chain before the transaction is broadcast to the network.\\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss the Latest MAINNET 2, Akash, and AKT News!**\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n[**Join our Telegram**](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest news, giveaways, and invites to special events!\\n\\n[**Join our Discord developer chat**](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67) for technical support and information.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash MAINNET 2 Product Update&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash MAINNET 2, the world\u2019s first decentralized open-source cloud, has been five years in the making, and it\u2019s only been two weeks since we launched on Monday, March 8th, 2021.

Middleware is needed to improve performance that can be built by developers for their needs. In order to deliver superior experiences, developers need to be able to build their own silver bullet. The ability to deploy trusted middleware in a permissionless and unstoppable way that\u2019s neither limited nor stateless allows for greater flexibility and quality performance, all at a reduced cost.\\n\\n\u201cAkash makes foundational digital infrastructure more consumable and more secure, opening the door to all kinds of use cases,\u201d said Jacob Smith, VP of Bare Metal Marketing &amp; Strategy. \u201cAs enterprises and startups alike continue to wrestle with how to confidently scale in an increasingly decentralized world, platforms like Akash provide a compelling new option.\u201d\\n\\nBy providing unused cloud capacity in a market-driven price format versus a traditional and central mechanism that determines pricing, Akash allows for price efficiency and lower cost computing determined by a free market. The platform expands access to Equinix Metal\u2019s powerful bare metal infrastructure and supports new use cases across the emerging blockchain industry. This advances the blockchain ecosystem at large, especially decentralized finance (DeFi), applications (dApps), validators, and organizations (DAO\u2019s), as it provides developers with a non-custodial, permissionless and secure cloud computing alternative.\\n\\nTo learn more about Akash Network\u2019s integration with Equinix, join CTO Adam Bozanich later today, Wednesday, March 3rd at 7:50 pm EST at [Equinix Metal\u2019s Proximity technical user conference](https://metal.equinix.com/proximity/) for a live demo.\\n\\n**For the latest Akash, AKT, and Mainnet 2 news and promotions, join our Telegram!**\\n\\n[Join our Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network Integrates with Equinix Metal to Provide the First Viable Decentralized Cloud Solution&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that Akash Network is integrating with Equinix Metal and enabling developers and companies to decentralize their cloud infrastructure through Akash DeCloud Mainnet 2.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-03-03T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.Bu5aIPIQ.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1024],&quot;height&quot;:[0,768],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-network-integrates-with-equinix-metal-to-provide-the-first-viable-decentralized-cloud-solution/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-develops-critical-ibc-relayer-for-inter-blockchain-communication-protocol/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-develops-critical-ibc-relayer-for-inter-blockchain-communication-protocol&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;  \\nBlockchain\u2019s wider adoption and acceleration has been limited by the scalability issue. There have been many efforts to solve the scalability challenge, including developing faster databases with hardware to increase transactions per second (TPS), and \u201csharding\u201d the blockchain, where a chain's transactional load is split and distributed among a large quantity of network partitions (shards).\\n\\nHaving been [early supporters and adopters of Cosmos and Tendermint](https://akash.network/blog/decentralized-serverless-computing-coming-to-cosmos/), we\u2019ve been incredibly excited about Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), led by Cosmos Network\u2019s non-profit Interchain Foundation.\\n\\n#### **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nIn development for over three years, IBC is the flagship feature of the Cosmos Network.

Essential to launching the IBC protocol and the only way users will be able to use IBC, the Relayer is the user interface that enables all transfers and transactions on IBC.  \\n\\nWe migrated and developed features from Cosmos\u2019s Game of Zones, Cosmos\u2019s proof-of-concept testnet, to a production ready IBC-compatible Relayer.  \\n\\nFollowing are the key features we worked on for the IBC Relayer:  \\n\\n*   **API Server:** We implemented an end-to-end API server that allows clients to interact with IBC chains. This feature allows the Relayer to expose an RPC server that enables a user to make common queries and use all the relayer functionality against a programmatic HTTP interface, i.e. a website. This feature will also allow for remote management of relayer nodes.\\n    \\n\\n*   **Improved Client-side Validations:** We improved the security and robustness of the Relayer by improving client-side validations for messages.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **Added Support for Client, Connection, and Channel Recycling:** This feature is a crucial performance enhancement for the IBC network, and reduces the number of connections needed between different servers, improving efficiency and speed in the system.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **Automatic Updates to Clients for Preventing Expiry:** We added crucial usability improvements such as automatic client updates to prevent expiration of IBC clients, reducing management and monitoring of the system.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **Typed Events:** This feature simplifies the code base and makes it easier for clients to consume events from all Cosmos SDK-based chains. It also makes the system more stable and greatly improves the developer experience.\\n    \\n\\n*   **Architecture Decision Records (ADR) in Cosmos SDK:** Our submission for how we want to design events was integrated into the latest Cosmos SDK and will be incorporated into the Relayer.\\n    \\n\\n#### **Akash MAINNET 2, One of the First Networks Integrated with IBC**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWe look forward to seeing how the community uses the Relayer. Once IBC launches on Thursday, February 18, 2021, we\u2019ll continue to maintain and manage the IBC Relayer, and make improvements.  \\n\\nOur upcoming Akash MAINNET 2, the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud marketplace, will be one of the first networks in the Cosmos ecosystem to have IBC and IBC Relayer integrated.  \\n\\nWith IBC and IBC Relayer, Akash DeCloud\u2019s multi-currency settlement and the ability to pay for cloud compute using stablecoins (such as Kava\u2019s USDX) will be coming much sooner, rather than later. Decentralized organizations will be able to purchase cloud compute programmatically on Akash DeCloud, instead of relying on centralized exchanges.  \\n\\nAkash\u2019s work on IBC will enable us to adopt and benefit from interchain technologies faster than other networks. Akash DeCloud, integrated with IBC, will enable more composability, innovation, and scaling for DeFi and decentralized organizations.  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n**For the latest Akash, AKT, and Mainnet 2 news and promotions, join our Telegram!**  \\n\\n[Join The Unstoppable Cloud](https://t.me/AkashNW)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network Develops Critical IBC Relayer for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Blockchain\u2019s wider adoption and acceleration has been limited by the scalability issue. There have been many efforts to solve the scalability challenge, including developing faster databases with hardware to increase transactions per second (TPS), and \u201csharding\u201d the blockchain, where a chain's transactional load is split and distributed among a large quantity of network partitions (shards).&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-02-18T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;News&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.mUJQpkFt.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;height&quot;:[0,675],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-network-develops-critical-ibc-relayer-for-inter-blockchain-communication-protocol/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-decloud-mainnet-2-teaser/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-decloud-mainnet-2-teaser&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;  \\nFive years ago, when my cofounder Greg Osuri and I set out to build Akash Network, we had previously worked as open source developers and experienced first-hand the constraints of centralized cloud service providers.  \\n\\nWith accelerating consumer demand for throughput and high DevOps server management costs, exacerbated by an ongoing pandemic that has moved more of our work and lives online, the cloud computing industry is rapidly expanding into a $370+ billion market by 2022.&nbsp;  \\n\\nDominated by an oligarchy of four cloud service providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud) who own over 71% of the market, this market concentration has given way to pricing inefficiency and anti-competitive practices that have resulted in higher cloud costs, and stifled innovation and flexibility.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe growth of DeFi and decentralized projects are limited by high transaction costs, scalability, high censorship and security risks on centralized cloud platforms.  \\n\\nDecentralized cloud platforms have appeared in the market, but have failed to gain traction due to limited use cases, complexity of technical integration and adoption, and a lack of price advantages.\\n\\n#### **Akash DeCloud, the First Decentralized Cloud Marketplace**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWith no viable alternative to the centralized cloud providers, Greg and I set out to realize the vision of a permissionless, sovereign, and open cloud where builders would have more freedom and flexibility to create, and to scale.  \\n\\nWith advanced containerization technology and a unique staking model to accelerate adoption, Akash DeCloud will be a faster, more efficient, and lower cost cloud built for DeFi, decentralized projects, and high growth companies, providing unprecedented scale, flexibility, and price performance.&nbsp;  \\n\\nCurrently 2x-3x lower in cost (up to 10x in the future) than the market, our serverless computing platform is compatible with all cloud providers and all applications that run on the cloud, easily integrating with a company\u2019s existing technology stack.  \\n\\nMainnet 2 is the materialization of Akash DeCloud, our vision for a decentralized cloud computing marketplace. Mainnet 2 is the culmination of all the invaluable learnings and user feedback from the three phases of The Akashian Challenge testnet we ran throughout 2020.  \\n\\nMainnet 2 will enable developers and organizations to set up their own provider, deploy their applications on Akash DeCloud, and participate in the cloud computing marketplace - either as a provider or a user deploying their application.  \\n\\n[Phase 3 of The Akashian Challenge showcased what is possible to deploy](https://akash.network/blog/akash-decloud-from-phase-3-to-mainnet-2/) on Mainnet 2, including DeFi apps, blogs, games, databases, data visualizations, block explorers, blockchain nodes and other blockchain network components.  \\n\\nA few examples from the [full Awesome Akash list](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash):  \\n\\n*   **DeFi** - SushiSwap &amp; UniSwap\\n    \\n*   **Blog** - Ghost &amp; Wordpress\\n    \\n*   **Games** - DOOM &amp; Super Mario\\n    \\n*   **Databases** - mongoDB &amp; MySQL\\n    \\n*   **Data Visualization** - UFO Sightings\\n    \\n*   **Block Explorers** - Big Dipper &amp; Aneka\\n    \\n\\n#### **Akash DeCloud: Mainnet 2 Developer Experience**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nCentralized cloud providers can be inflexible, expensive, and susceptible to outages, security concerns, and censorship.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \\n\\n**Mainnet 2 provides a Uniswap-style experience to cloud deployments in a cost-efficient, permissionless, censorship-resistant, and non-custodial way.**  \\n\\nTenants (Developers) define workload requirements, as well as regional and pricing parameters, in a manifest file using a declarative language called SDL (inspired by Docker Compose) and request resources from the Network.  \\n\\nFrom there on, Akash handles the heavy lift of deployment and fault tolerance. Should a provider go down, for example, the hosted application is seamlessly transitioned to another provider, ensuring consistent uptime.&nbsp;  \\n\\nDevelopers who participated in our testnets found this experience significantly better than their experiences deploying on the centralized cloud. You can check out [SDL files](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) for a diverse set of apps launched during The Akashian Challenge Phase 3.  \\n\\n**Following are the main features of Mainnet 2:**  \\n\\n*   **Decentralized Cloud Compute Marketplace**: As the core function of Akash DeCloud, developers and Akash providers will participate in an on-chain auction system where supply and demand for cloud compute is exchanged.\\n    \\n\\n*   **Flexible Bid Pricing**: Providers can configure their pricing based on parameters such as CPU count, storage capacity, and endpoints.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **IBC Compatibility**: Mainnet 2 will be fully compatible with Cosmos SDK v0.41.0, also known as [Stargate](https://stargate.cosmos.network/). Stargate enables functionality for Cosmos SDK-based blockchains, like Akash, to connect with each other using the first ever standardized protocol for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).\\n    \\n\\n*   **Deployment Tool:** The deployment tool streamlines the developer experience and helps seamlessly launch their applications on Akash.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **Audited Attributes**: Audited attributes allow users deploying applications to be more selective about which providers can run their apps. Anyone on the Akash blockchain can assign these attributes to Providers via an on-chain transaction.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **Tendermint\u2019s State Sync**: State sync allows developers to quickly bring up nodes, which is ideal for use cases such as querying the blockchain or using a web wallet.\\n    \\n\\n#### **Stargate and Inter-Blockchain Communication Integration**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nTo gain wider adoption and achieve consumer scale in high growth industries like decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain-based systems need to solve the scalability problem. The ability to transact quickly across chains will be transformational for the industry.  \\n\\nFor crypto and blockchain, where interoperability and composability are essential to continued growth for decentralized sectors like DeFi, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is the most promising and production-ready solution.&nbsp;  \\n\\nMainnet 2 provides full compatibility with Cosmos SDK\u2019s IBC-enabled Stargate upgrade out-of-the-box. The implementation and adoption of IBC within the Cosmos ecosystem will enable more projects to exchange value across the Cosmos Hub, and participate in Akash's decentralized marketplace.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWith IBC, Akash reduces the barrier to adoption by allowing other currencies to access and transact within the cloud compute marketplace.  \\n\\nAdditionally, [Akash Network\u2019s partnership with ICF](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-cosmoss-interchain-foundation-to-accelerate-development-of-inter-blockchain-communication/), and our integral contribution to the development of IBC Relayer will enable us to adopt and benefit from interchain technologies faster than any other company.\\n\\n#### **Mainnet 2, Progression of Akash DeCloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nMainnet 2 progresses Akash\u2019s vision for DeCloud in multiple ways. First, it empowers developers to break free from the limitations of traditional cloud infrastructure and launch their applications on a secure, cost-efficient, and censorship resistant decentralized cloud computing platform.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAdditionally, Mainnet 2 enables individuals and organizations with underutilized computing capacity to monetize and lease their compute to those who need it, recouping costs such as maintenance, capital expenditure, and other expenses.&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Akash DeCloud: Mainnet 2 Launch Timeline**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThe exact date of the Mainnet 2 launch is dependent on multiple factors.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe Cosmos Hub\u2019s upgrade to Stargate needs to be complete--at the time of this article, the proposal is still in the voting period stage. Once the Cosmos Hub has successfully upgraded, this will signal finalization of the Stargate software, and Akash\u2019s implementation will function as intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \\n\\nAkash\u2019s validator community is currently testing to simulate the network upgrade and identify potential issues with the upgrade path and integrations.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThere is an active governance proposal to signal overall approval and preparedness for the upgrade to Mainnet 2. Details of the proposal can be found [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUe8PVfxHN5ufct6c4H1nhBjJpXSxvS5QLGkUnsNwJ5em). The result of this proposal will be known February 17th, 2021.  \\n\\nOnce the proposal passes, a subsequent proposal will be created and will include the exact date and software version of the upgrade. On the secondary proposal passing, the Mainnet 2 upgrade will occur on the specified date.  \\n\\nIf testing is deemed successful and the initial signaling proposal passes, the earliest date the secondary upgrade proposal can pass will be March 3rd, 2021.  \\n\\nStay tuned for more information on our launch of Mainnet 2.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n**For the latest Akash, AKT, and Mainnet 2 news and promotions, join our Telegram!**  \\n\\n[Join The Unstoppable Cloud](https://t.me/AkashNW)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash DeCloud: Mainnet 2 Teaser&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Five years ago, when my cofounder Greg Osuri and I set out to build Akash Network, we had previously worked as open source developers and experienced first-hand the constraints of centralized cloud service providers.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-02-11T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Adam Bozanich&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.D19b_c0D.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;height&quot;:[0,675],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-decloud-mainnet-2-teaser/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akt-token-now-on-digifinex-exchange/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akt-token-now-on-digifinex-exchange&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n**Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that Akash Token (AKT) is now available on** [**DigiFinex**](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/)**, a world-leading digital assets exchange.**\\n\\n**DigiFinex is offering $200,000 of AKT in rewards through a series of promotional events, to support the listing and trading of AKT/USDT.**\\n\\n[**Check out DigiFinex\u2019s announcement**](https://digifinex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004237886) **to learn how you can participate and win!**\\n\\n[**DigiFinex**](https://www.digifinex.com/) **will be our fourth exchange listing after** [**BitMax**](https://bitmax.io/en/global-digital-asset-platform)**,** [**BitMart**](https://www.bitmart.com/)**, and** [**Bithumb Global**](https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us)**.**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925204-digifinex-ama-554x1024.jpg)\\n\\nOn Wednesday February 3rd 7pm PST / Thursday February 4th 11am SGT, Digifinex CXO Kiana Shek is hosting our CFO Cheng Wang for an AMA in [DigiFinex\u2019s AMA Telegram group](https://t.me/DigiFinexAMA).\\n\\nCheng will share **How Akash Network is Building the Future of the Cloud**.\\n\\nAs we work to launch the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud, our upcoming Mainnet 2 with Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) integrated, we look forward to expanding global access to AKT, and welcoming new Akashians into [our community](https://t.me/AkashNW).\\n\\nTo support our accelerating growth and increasing global demand for access to Akash Token (AKT), we\u2019ll continue to focus on expanding liquidity for AKT.\\n\\nAs the utility token powering [the world\u2019s first DeCloud for DeFi](https://akash.network/blog/akash-decloud-for-defi/) and high growth organizations, **Akash Token (AKT) has ~51% APR staking rewards, and currently enjoys a record-setting ~90% bonding rate**.\\n\\n#### **AKT Listing on DigiFinex**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Starting today, you can** [**buy AKT on DigiFinex**](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/).

Previously, deploying an application on Akash required numerous transactions and manual variable declarations.\\n\\nThe process went something like this--send a transaction, wait, send another transaction to confirm the previous one worked as expected, then repeat those steps until deployment is complete.\\n\\nNow, even as the process is nearly identical behind the scenes, the user experience is greatly enhanced because it only takes one transaction to deploy an application.\\n\\n**COSMOS SDK V0.40.0 UPDATE**\\n\\nAkash\u2019s software is [now compatible](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1016) with the renowned [v0.40.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.40.0) of Cosmos SDK, also known as [Stargate](https://stargate.cosmos.network/). Stargate enables functionality for Cosmos SDK-based blockchains, like Akash, to connect with each other using the first ever standardized protocol for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).\\n\\nIn addition to enabling IBC, Akash\u2019s upgrade to Stargate will bring additional features such as state sync, automatic upgrades, and full-featured light clients.\\n\\n**HOSTNAME VALIDATION**\\n\\nThe [Hostname Validation feature](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1024) allows Akash providers to evaluate hostnames before accepting a deployment manifest and ultimately hosting the associated application.&nbsp; If a provider sees a manifest and the specified hostname is already in use, the provider will reject the manifest.\\n\\nWhen a deployment closes for any reason, its hostname will be released and made available for future use.\\n\\nHostname validation will also enable providers to block specific hostnames or domains.\\n\\n**IMPLEMENT mTLS AUTHENTICATION**\\n\\nTLS, or Transport Layer Security, is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communications between web servers and web browsers (clients). With TLS, the client verifies the identity of the server, and a secure connection is made - the server doesn\u2019t necessarily care about the identity of the client.\\n\\nOn Akash, the provider (server) doesn\u2019t want just anyone (client) to be able to access it and to make HTTP requests. If a client makes a request for a resource that they are not authorized to access, that request should be denied.\\n\\nTo solve this, mTLS, or mutual Transport Layer Security, is [now implemented](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/1017) on Akash. Certificates of accounts are stored on-chain so that both the client and the server can look up each other\u2019s certificates.\\n\\nBefore mTLS, anyone could access logs and status for a tenant\u2019s lease from the provider. With mTLS incorporated, the client and server each verify each other\u2019s identities before a trusted communications line can be established.\\n\\n**INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS**\\n\\nThe testnet exposed corner-cases in the compute inventory management of provider services. While fixing these issues, we made inventory management more flexible, and we thoroughly tested final changes to ensure that it will behave as expected.\\n\\n####\\n\\n**What\u2019s Next?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**ESCROW ACCOUNTS &amp; PAYMENTS**\\n\\nThis is a mechanism to allow time-based payments from one account to another, without block-by-block micropayments. They also support holding funds for an account until an arbitrary event occurs.\\n\\n**EXPOSE KUBERNETES EVENT LOGS**\\n\\nWith this functionality, tenants can fetch Kubernetes events for any given lease and help them debug if there are any errors.\\n\\n**ON-CHAIN RESOURCE LIMIT PARAMETERS**\\n\\nCurrently provider resource limit parameters are hard-coded in Akash\u2019s software. We\u2019ll be moving these on-chain so they can be changed via governance proposals.\\n\\nPhase 3 Testnet exceeded our expectations, and showcased the beginnings of what is possible on Akash DeCloud.

In the race to find a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19, access to cloud computing has been critical, not just for startups, but also for academic institutions, researchers, and clinicians.&nbsp;  \\n\\nMy cofounder and CTO Adam Bozanich and I started Akash Network to enable developers and organizations around the world to have greater access, freedom, and flexibility to build and grow. As open source developers, we wanted to create an alternative to the pricing inefficiency, inflexibility, and anti-competitive practices of centralized cloud service providers.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe pandemic has been a humbling experience that not only made us revisit our priorities, but strengthened our focus and commitment to materializing The Unstoppable Cloud, the first viable alternative to centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.  \\n\\nMore than ever, we need a decentralized, permissionless, and open cloud where people become _participants_ in their future.  \\n\\nProgress to our vision is a marathon and not a sprint, and our success depends on a team that relentlessly ships, and the continued support of Akashians around the world.  \\n\\nI\u2019m proud to share 2020 milestones that we achieved across our product, partnerships, promotions, and people, that accelerate us to the DeCloud in 2021.\\n\\n#### **Highlights from 2020 in the Cloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n  \\n**PRODUCT**\\n\\n2020 was a landmark year for our product milestones. In Q1 2020, we migrated to **Cosmos SDK** and in the process, **we** _**reduced our codebase by a massive 150,000 lines**_. In order to provide a framework for others to create and run their own testnets, we captured our learnings in the [**Decentralized Cloud Standards**](https://dcs.akash.network/spec/dcs-4).  \\n\\nWe also evolved our **Akash Network Token Economic Model**. We [introduced two additional powerful drivers](https://akash.network/blog/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/) for growth and income generation in the ecosystem\u2013the allocation of subsidies, in the form of a Subsidy Pool and the distribution of a network dividend from a portion of the lease fees, Take Income.  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925267-hero1-1024x724.png)\\n\\n  \\nIn Q2 2020, we launched **The Akashian Challenge Incentivized Testnet**, one of the largest and most ambitious testnets in the decentralized ecosystem. During Phase 1, our testnet withstood an AWS outage that brought down the centralized cloud (and internet). It also weathered [a massive zero fee transaction attack](https://medium.com/@novysf/the-outcome-from-akash-testnet-zero-fee-transaction-attack-5fd4aaa68d97). Both the AWS outage and the attack showcased the resilience of our decentralized platform.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn the initial phases of The Akashian Challenge, we tested governance and voting, and improved the process for network upgrades to strengthen our platform. These explorations gave us critical insights on how to build a healthy and vital community for growth, and led to the successful [**launch of our Mainnet 1**](https://akash.network/blog/announcing-akash-mainnet-live-and-bitmax-ieo/) **with a full 64-validator set.**  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925362-phase-3-live-banner-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nIn **The Akashian Challenge Phase 3**, we integrated performance enhancements from Cosmos SDK v0.40, and tested Akash DeCloud\u2019s deployment platform. With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) in rewards and hundreds of participants joining from around the world, [The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-rewards-overview/) included guided and open ended challenges.\\n\\nPhase 3 testnet participation, deployments, and learnings, exceeded our expectations:\\n\\n*   **3800+ applications deployed**\\n    \\n*   **500+ developers**\\n    \\n*   **149 registered validators**\\n    \\n\\nDuring Phase 3, [**Forbole**](https://www.forbole.com/) deployed their Big Dipper block explorer on Akash DeCloud, making it the first instance of a prominent block explorer to migrate from centralized cloud to decentralized cloud.&nbsp;\\n\\n[**Serum DEX**](https://dex.projectserum.com/#/market/H3APNWA8bZW2gLMSq5sRL41JSMmEJ648AqoEdDgLcdvB) UI became the first instance a major DeFi project is hosted on the DeCloud. You can check out the [full Awesome Akash list](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) for a complete listing of the apps that were deployed in Phase 3.\\n\\nIn the middle of all this action, **Akash surpassed 1,000,000 blocks.**\\n\\nThrough running three phases of The Akashian Challenge, we\u2019ve been able to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability before launching our DeCloud: Mainnet 2.&nbsp;  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926574-supermini-1024x538.png)\\n\\n  \\nLeveraging Akash\u2019s proprietary cloud and blockchain technologies, developed over five years, [**Supermini**](https://akash.network/supermini/) will be manufactured and launched in the United States with premium materials and powerful processors.\\n\\nWe progressed design, technical specifications, and production on **Supermini**. We worked with [**design duo Guillermo Sanchez del Corral and Rafael Saenz of debuti**](https://www.debuti.art/), and [**industrial designer Sungbum Park**](https://www.sungbumpark.com/), to come up with Supermini\u2019s distinctive chassis and infinity mirror design.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe launched a test online pre-order campaign and **sold out within 3 weeks of the campaign launch**. Production is underway for a limited launch later this year.&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**AKT Token Initial Exchange Offering &amp; Liquidity**\\n\\nIn Q3, we launched Akash Mainnet 1 and **held the Akash Token (AKT) IEO on BitMax**, one of the world\u2019s top exchanges. Mainnet 1 was the beginning of Akash DeCloud and network governance, enabling staking and governance operations including the ability to delegate to validators and vote on governance proposals.\\n\\nShortly after, we announced a second exchange listing on [BitMart](https://www.bitmart.com/), a premier global digital asset platform and ranked among the top crypto exchanges on CoinMarketCap!\\n\\nAs the first Akash exchange partner to enable residents of the United States to access AKT, BitMart enabled more Akashians around the world access to AKT, and to AKT staking rewards.  \\n\\n  \\n  \\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\\n\\nOur goal is to provide developers with increased access to decentralized services. Towards this end, we [announced that **we were partnering with Solana**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-solana-to-bring-web-scale-smart-contracts-to-supercloud/) to bring web-scale smart contracts to Akash DeCloud.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash users will be able to run secure and scalable smart contracts on Solana\u2019s hyper-performant platform and pay using Akash Token (AKT). Solana\u2019s users will soon be able to run distributed applications (like machine learning or web apps) and settle using Solana Token (SOL) on Akash. Our partnership will also give Solana Validators the ability to run their nodes on a truly decentralized cloud and significantly decrease their cloud costs.  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926586-interchain-banner-copy-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nWe announced [a partnership with **Cosmos's ICF to make IBC protocol a reality**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-cosmoss-interchain-foundation-to-accelerate-development-of-inter-blockchain-communication/), enabling us to integrate interchain technologies faster than any other company. With this partnership, Akash solidifies an essential position in the Cosmos ecosystem to accelerate development of the IBC interoperability protocol.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be working on the leading edge of research, deploying live production systems to make IBC a reality. **Our partnership will increase composability and massive scaling for decentralized projects like DeFi**.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn Q3, we [announced an integration with **Kava**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-integrates-kava-labss-usdx/), the first cross-blockchain DeFi platform, to enable Kava\u2019s stablecoin USDX as the first coin for fee settlement on Akash\u2019s DeCloud platform. The integration with Kava will also enable Akash Token (AKT) to be used as collateral for USDX loans.\\n\\nThis integration strengthens AKT\u2019s liquidity and provides Akash users with a stable medium of exchange, while achieving greater adoption for Kava\u2019s stablecoin and an increased debt ceiling from AKT collateral.&nbsp;  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926602-chainlink-banner-1024x768.png)\\n\\n  \\nWe announced that Akash Network is to integrate with [**Chainlink**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-to-integrate-chainlink-oracles-to-power-pricing-data/), the market-leading decentralized oracle network. By integrating with Chainlink, we\u2019ll be able to ensure that Akash\u2019s users have access to the most secure and accurate price data available. We look forward to expanding the integration with Chainlink to bring on-chain data for application uptime to Akash DeCloud.\\n\\nWe announced our integration with [**Cosmostation, the number one wallet for the Cosmos ecosystem**](https://akash.network/blog/akash-network-announces-integration-partnership-with-cosmostation-wallet/). A trusted wallet provider for other top Cosmos projects including Akash partner Kava Labs, Terra, and Iris, Cosmostation is built on the Cosmos SDK and has mobile wallet apps on Android and iOS.&nbsp;  \\n\\n  \\n  \\n**PROMOTIONS**\\n\\nIn support of aggressive company and product goals, our team worked across branding, content, community, communication, events, partnership marketing, KOL/media engagement, and acquisition marketing to achieve key Growth metrics in 2020:\\n\\n**Growth Metrics**\\n\\n*   Product:\\n    \\n    *   **AKT Token: 5x growth in price in 3 months**\\n        \\n    *   **The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: 3,800 Applications; ~500 Developers**\\n        \\n    *   **Supermini: $300,000 Supermini Pre-Orders (Sold Out)**\\n        \\n    *   **Mainnet 1: 64 Validators**  \\n        \\n*   Community:\\n    \\n    *   **10,700 Twitter Followers (10x)**\\n        \\n    *   **7,236 Telegram Members (5x)**\\n        \\n    *   **5,000 WeChat Members**  \\n        \\n*   Thought Leadership:\\n    \\n    *   **71 Blog Articles**\\n        \\n    *   **38 AMAs / Events**\\n        \\n\\n  \\n**Global Expansion**\\n\\nAt Akash Network, outside of the US, our Chinese audience makes up the second largest group of visitors to our website and communities.

We were excited to announce that [**Brian** joined as an **Akash Advisor**](https://akash.network/blog/announcing-akash-advisor-brian-fox-creator-of-bash-shell/). His strategic and technical guidance, experience, and ideas will be invaluable as we build the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud to enable greater access, flexibility, and freedom for builders of the future.\\n\\n#### **2021 Journey to the DeCloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nEarly in 2021, our first priority will be launching **Mainnet 2**, the materialization of our DeCloud. Mainnet 2 will be the world\u2019s first non-custodial cloud with a decentralized attribution model. Users will be able to set up their own provider and deploy their applications onto Akash DeCloud.  \\n\\nOur team will also be improving the developer experience, which includes building **improved provider tooling, enhanced deployment tooling, and enabling more customizable attribute matching** in the deployment process.  \\n\\nOur continuing work with **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)** will unlock unprecedented levels of value exchange between networks in the Cosmos Ecosystem at first, and expand to other networks such as Ethereum, eventually connecting the entire crypto space.\\n\\nThe implementation and adoption of IBC within the Cosmos ecosystem will allow more projects to exchange value across the Cosmos Hub, and participate in Akash's decentralized marketplace. With IBC, Akash will reduce the barrier to adoption by enabling other currencies to access our cloud marketplace and pay for cloud compute.\\n\\nIn the immediate future, Akash will leverage money markets such as **THORChain** and Kava to improve liquidity. **With the launch of Althea\u2019s Peggy, Akash will be able to interoperate with Etherum, enabling AKT access via DEXs such as Uniswap**.\\n\\nAkash's upcoming **Mainnet 2 is IBC enabled, running on Cosmos SDK 0.4.0**. The first use case for IBC is DEX support, both for the Cosmos ecosystem and for Ethereum\u2014with strong demand from our users, we're excited about this.\\n\\nIBC will progress our vision for a truly decentralized and interoperable cloud. One could store data on a storage network FileCoin on Sia, use KMS on NuCypher, manage DNS on Handshake, and pay for all of these services using Akash Token (AKT).&nbsp;\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve accelerated our milestones and expanded globally, we\u2019ve focused on expanding liquidity for AKT to support our growth, and to meet increasing global demand for access to AKT. In January, we **announced our third exchange listing on** [**Bithumb Global**](https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us)**,** **and we\u2019ll continue to increase AKT liquidity this year.**\\n\\n**Akash will become a gateway to the decentralized cloud, powered by IBC.**\\n\\nLater in 2021, we\u2019ll be launching **the first production run of our Supermini** portable supercomputers and enabling people around the world to join DeCloud and earn AKT.\\n\\n**This year, Akash is** _**truly Unstoppable**_**!**\\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss the Latest News!**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n[Join our Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest news, giveaways, and invites to special events!&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;2020 to 2021: Acceleration to the DeCloud&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In 2020, the pandemic shifted more of our work and personal lives online, accelerating explosive demand for cloud computing and services, projected to be a $370 billion market by 2022 (IDG 2019).&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2021-01-19T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Greg Osuri&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CJg3bMde.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;height&quot;:[0,675],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/2020-to-2021-acceleration-to-the-decloud/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-decloud-from-phase-3-to-mainnet-2/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-decloud-from-phase-3-to-mainnet-2&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nThrough running three phases of The Akashian Challenge, one of the ecosystem\u2019s most ambitious testnets, we\u2019ve been able to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability before launching our DeCloud: Mainnet 2.\\n\\nIn the initial phases of The Akashian Challenge, we tested governance and voting, and improved the process for network upgrades to strengthen our platform.

Challengers also deployed video games and well-known DeFi apps on Akash including SushiSwap and UniSwap.\\n\\nBy having its frontend deployed on Akash\u2019s decentralized cloud, UniSwap can provide its users unstoppable access to $1.4 billion of liquidity that can\u2019t be shut down by centralized cloud providers.\\n\\nDuring all this action, Akash surpassed 1,000,000 blocks.\\n\\nAmong the coolest Awesome Akash apps deployed:\\n\\n- **DeFi** - SushiSwap &amp; UniSwap\\n\\n- **Blog** - Ghost &amp; Wordpress\\n\\n- **Games** - DOOM &amp; Super Mario\\n\\n- **Databases** - mongoDB &amp; MySQL\\n\\n- **Data Visualization** - UFO Sightings\\n\\n- **Block Explorers** - Big Dipper &amp; Aneka\\n\\nYou can check out the [full Awesome Akash list](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) for more.\\n\\n#### **The Journey to Mainnet 2**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAmong the learnings from Phase 3 that we\u2019ll leverage for Mainnet 2:\\n\\n**Tendermint\u2019s State Sync works!** After some tinkering, we discovered a way to use state sync to quickly bring up nodes. This is great for developers who want to quickly bring up a node for any number of uses - querying the blockchain, using a web wallet, etc.\\n\\nWe identified **pain points in the deployment process,** which currently requires multiple transactions and is quite cumbersome. We\u2019re now developing a tool to streamline the process.\\n\\nWe also realized we need **better feedback (logs) when deployments are failing**. If an application uses too much memory, it terminates without telling the user specifically why. The \\\\`command\\\\` and \\\\`args\\\\` service fields of the SDL file aren't documented well enough. The service won\u2019t start if these fields are not inputted correctly. We now know we\u2019ll need to add validation up-front for items like invalid environment or service names.\\n\\nWe discovered that **inventory management needs tuning**. Under heavy load, there were cases where the provider would bid on orders that it didn\u2019t have sufficient capacity to run. These deployments would wait for other workloads to complete, but if that didn\u2019t happen in time, the workload would time out and be killed.\\n\\nUltimately, our aim was for Phase 3 to accelerate our vision for a decentralized cloud computing marketplace by serving as the launchpad for Mainnet 2. We\u2019ll continue to study the data and feedback from Phase 3 and leverage the learnings to strengthen Mainnet 2.\\n\\n_**Stay tuned for more information on Akash DeCloud: Mainnet 2, launching early in Q1 2021.**_\\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss Critical Phase 3 Updates**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nJoin our [Discord dev](https://discord.akash.network/) chat for technical support and information.\\n\\nJoin our [Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest Akash Network and AKT announcements, events, and giveaways.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash DeCloud: From Phase 3 to Mainnet 2&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Through running three phases of The Akashian Challenge, one of the ecosystem\u2019s most ambitious testnets, we\u2019ve been able to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability before launching our DeCloud Mainnet 2.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-12-23T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Adam Bozanich&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.BzJ7y3xJ.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;height&quot;:[0,675],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-decloud-from-phase-3-to-mainnet-2/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;huobi-pool-partners-with-akash-network/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;huobi-pool-partners-with-akash-network&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;  \\nIn the cryptocurrency world, Huobi needs no further introduction, and Huobi Global Exchange is renowned around the world as one of the top two crypto exchanges.&nbsp;  \\n\\nLaunched in 2018, Huobi Pool is Huobi Group\u2019s mining and staking division. To date, Huobi Pool has grown staking operations to become the largest staking pool, participating in more than 40 proof of stake (PoS) projects, and is a leading proof of work (PoW) pool. Additionally, Huobi Pool ranked in the top three nodes in more than half of the projects it participated in.  \\n\\n**Today, we\u2019re thrilled to announce that Huobi Pool has joined Akash Network as a validator. With global leadership in staking operations and as one of Huobi Group\u2019s fastest growing divisions, Huobi Pool will be a valuable partner as we accelerate development of Akash DeCloud, the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud, for high growth industries including DeFi, decentralized projects, and machine learning/AI, and expand our global ecosystem.**  \\n\\nWe recently connected with Ding Yuan, Huobi Pool\u2019s Chief Analyst, to learn more about the firm\u2019s approach and perspective, and to find out why they chose to partner with Akash.\\n\\n#### **Interview with Ding Yuan, Chief Analyst at Huobi Pool**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925199-yvvt7277bs9nckcxstfqy7rrompivtgm0m51c33sgojushkkaulvctirjigsijprtsolz9zwxngmjz5ogb8x8w-7zsplhytvrkme3iiesziccq-s80xpabnchgig6ca1sla1c.jpeg)\\n\\n  \\n**How and why was Huobi Pool created?**  \\n\\nDing: Huobi Group is one of the world\u2019s biggest crypto companies and our business covers almost the entire industry. As an integral part of the industry, the mining pool protects the security of the blockchain network and plays the role of infrastructure in the blockchain world. So Huobi Pool was set up for mining and also, staking business.  \\n\\n  \\n**How is Houbi Pool affiliated with Huobi exchange?**  \\n\\nDing: Many Huobi exchange users are also Bitcoin miners. Huobi Pool can provide them with, not only mining services, but also liquidity, financial derivatives, and other value-added services in combination with the exchange business.&nbsp;  \\n\\nBesides, dozens of staking services provided by Huobi exchange are actually operated by Huobi Pool. So far, we have provided users with staking services in more than 40 projects including ETH2.0.  \\n\\n  \\n**What is the goal of the organization?**  \\n\\nDing: Our goal is to provide users with the most professional mining and staking services.  \\n\\n  \\n**How do you select which projects to work with?**  \\n\\nDing: We will judge a project from different angles. We like a professional and experienced team--the technology should be creative, and the project can really solve problems.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAlso, we focus on the economic model and the inflation mechanism.  \\n\\n  \\n**What motivated you to validate for Akash Network?**  \\n\\nDing: As I mentioned above, we have high requirements for the quality of the project we work with. Akash has an excellent and professional team. The company has good influence and reputation in the Cosmos ecosystem, and the economic model is solid, with no shortcomings.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWhat's more, we think Akash can solve real problems.  \\n\\n  \\n**What types of crypto projects are you excited about, and why?**  \\n\\nDing: The first criteria I consider is a good team. The team needs to be made up of people with expertise across different fields. Then, the project should have special achievements in the technical field. And then, have strong creativity--not just fork others.  \\n\\n  \\n**How do you envision blockchain changing the world?**  \\n\\nDing: The change that blockchain brings to the world is fundamental. It is different from the invention of the steam engine, which just improved productivity.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWhereas, blockchain technology will transform productivity by decentralization and token economy.  \\n\\n  \\n**What is your advice for those who want to enter the blockchain industry?**  \\n\\nDing: The first thing is to own bitcoin, because only by holding cryptocurrency, you can really appreciate its magic.  \\n\\nSecond, the industry needs you to have more energy and capabilities to capture information, because the speed of development in the blockchain industry is faster than in any others--you need to keep learning.  \\n\\nFinally, the value investment is very important. Don't throw away your precious coins because of speculation and leveraged trading.  \\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss Out!**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n[**Join our Telegram**](https://t.me/AkashNW) **for the latest Akash and AKT Token news, giveaways, and invites to special events!**  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n[**Join The Unstoppable Cloud**](https://t.me/AkashNW)\\n\\n  \\n  \\n**About Huobi Pool**  \\n\\nAs a significant part of Huobi Group's ecological layout, Huobi Pool mainly handles PoW mining, Staking mining and Huobi Pool ECO Exchange.

It\u2019s been exciting for us to see Akashian Challengers flex their technical chops through our guided and open ended challenges.\\n\\nJust in the first day of Phase 3, we\u2019ve seen 86+ application deployments in the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud. We appreciate the support of Phase 3 Challengers to help us build a stronger DeCloud.\\n\\n#### **Akash DeCloud Development Update**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**New Release Candidate**\\n\\nOn November 23rd, we cut a new release candidate of our software: [Akash v0.9.0-rc4](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.9.0-rc4).&nbsp; The primary feature of this release was the inclusion of Audited Attributes, which allows tenants to create leases only on providers who have met certain criteria and have that criteria verified, or audited, by a person or entity.\\n\\nFor example, Bob has a provider and declares its _region_ attribute to be US-West.&nbsp; Alice knows Bob personally and can confirm that his provider is in the US-West region, so she submits a transaction on the Akash blockchain signing off that his _region_ attribute is true.\\n\\nNow, Susan wants to launch an application onto Akash DeCloud, but has two requirements: first, it must run on a US-West server, and second, its region attribute must be audited by Alice, whom she trusts.&nbsp; Susan\u2019s application will now only be hosted by Bob, or any other provider that meets her two requirements.\\n\\n[This update](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/925) improves the Audited Attribute functionality by allowing more flexibility to the tenant for choosing an appropriate provider for their needs.\\n\\n**Documentation**\\n\\nTo help prepare the developer community for The Akashian Challenge Phase 3, we\u2019ve worked diligently to overhaul our documentation. Improved [metadata organization](https://github.com/ovrclk/net) now allows for a much cleaner and deliberate interface, enabling developers to more easily gather information to join our Mainnet or any current testnet.\\n\\n**Telemetry**\\n\\nThe Cosmos SDK contains functionality to gain insight into the performance and behavior of applications through the use of what\u2019s called a \u201ctelemetry package.\u201d&nbsp; As Akash is built on the Cosmos SDK, we utilize this telemetry data and are [working to add](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/921) additional metrics so developers have access to more detailed node information.\\n\\nSome of these new metrics will include deployment created, order created, order closed, and transfer amount.\\n\\n#### **What\u2019s Next?**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n- Gateway API authentication\\n- Provider services stability\\n- Provider services observability\\n- Provider services transaction batching\\n\\n#### **Don\u2019t Miss the Latest Akash Network Product Updates**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nJoin our [Discord dev chat](https://discord.com/invite/DxftX67) for technical support and information.\\n\\nJoin our [Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest Akash Network platform, product, and Akash Token (AKT) updates and announcements.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Developing DeCloud: Product Update 2&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Yesterday, on Monday, November 30th, we announced our second exchange listing on BitMart, further expanding liquidity for AKT token, and launched Phase 3, the third and final phase of The Akashian Challenge incentivized testnet.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Adam Bozanich&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.x-6wYany.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,660],&quot;height&quot;:[0,480],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/developing-decloud-product-update-2/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-week-1-is-live/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-week-1-is-live&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n**Akashian Challengers have landed, and The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Week 1 is officially LIVE!!!**\\n\\nPhase 3 is the last phase of our three phase incentivized testnet, and will take place over the next two weeks.\\n\\nWith 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) rewards at stake, you\u2019ll get the chance to explore the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud and help us build a strong Mainnet 2.\\n\\nStart the Week 1 challenges by clicking Get Started Now, or click on Learn More to visit The Akashian Challenge site for information on Week 1 challenges and rewards.\\n\\nLet the games begin!\\n\\n#### [**Get Started Now**](https://akash.network/docs/v/master/testnet-challenges/testnet-challenges) **|** [**Learn More**\\n\\n](https://akash.network/challenge/)\\n\\n#### **How to Join**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nTo start, please [sign up here](https://app.akash.network/signup) if you have not participated in Akash\u2019s previous testnets.\\n\\n1.  **KYC/AML:** Complete KYC/AML.

James Woolsey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html), advocating for open source election systems as a way to secure US elections against foreign interference.  \\n\\nWith decades advocating for, and advancing greater access to technology to improve people\u2019s lives, Brian espouses Akash\u2019s values of openness, sovereignty, equality, and empathy. He is also co-founder and CTO of [Orchid Labs](https://www.orchid.com/), the first incentivized, peer-to-peer privacy network.  \\n\\n**Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that Brian Fox has joined Akash Network as an Advisor. Brian\u2019s strategic and technical guidance, experience, and ideas will be invaluable as we build the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud to enable greater access, flexibility, and freedom for builders of the future.**&nbsp;  \\n\\nWe recently spoke with Brian about his perspectives on open source and blockchain adoption, and his current projects.\\n\\n####   \\n**How did you transition from open source to blockchain?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nFor me, it wasn't so much of a transition from open source--it was \u201cAha!\u201d. By the time I got involved in blockchain--which was 2016-2017--it was already well on its way. And I was impressed with the existing spread that was out there.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAnd that's what made me think that there could be an even wider spread and a more mainstream acceptance and utilization of blockchain.\\n\\n####   \\n**What is your perspective on the \u201ccorporatization\u201d of open source?**&nbsp;  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nIn my perspective, the reason for open source is the same reason for mathematical formulas. I don't want you to own a mathematical formula because what you're doing when you give it away is raising the bar of technology for humanity, including me. And even though I haven't monetarily benefited from it, if my ideas are disseminated, then other people get to leverage my ideas to progress innovation. Other people get to build on my ideas, which allows me to build on their ideas, and so on.  \\n\\nThe Bash shell, for example, runs on every OS and is delivered with almost every OS. And this is a useful piece of software that runs under the hood and powers a lot of technology.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAnd you can look at the impact of the Linux kernel. You've got Debian, which is 100% free. You've got Ubuntu, which is not 100% free.&nbsp;  \\n\\nYou have Cygnus, the world's first open source company started by my partner and friend David Wallace. Cygnus began by offering services support for free software, eventually merging with Red Hat, which now serves corporate customers. You've got IBM, stating that they are the world's largest open source company.  \\n\\nAnd yet still managing to make zillions of dollars.\\n\\n####   \\n**What are current blockchain projects that excite you, and why?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nAny project with the fundamental aim of spreading the network and bringing blockchain to places where it didn't normally exist. For example, I believe we need the same kind of nodes that we have on Amazon, in other places in the cloud.&nbsp;  \\n\\nI believe that having a small device that you can put in a person\u2019s home, like the Akash Supermini, is a great move. I also think that putting software on phones and creating incentives for participating is key for adoption. If you look around the world, no matter where you look, even if the rest of the technical infrastructure isn't there, mobile phone technology is everywhere.\\n\\nBeing able to bring blockchain technology to small tribal communities in Africa, for example, to allow people to make payments and secure their transactions, and enabling small to large organizations to get veracity in record-keeping into these communities.&nbsp;  \\n\\nBlockchain is an excellent solution for that.  \\n\\nThere are many other things we can do with blockchain in those communities. The sooner we get it into these global communities, the faster we'll find out how useful it really is.\\n\\n####   \\n**What do you think are the challenges for mainstream adoption of blockchain?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nBlockchain is still the Wild Wild West, and people are panning for gold. Somebody found that six pound nugget, and everybody else is now going nuts trying to pan for more. The reality is that most of this interest is driven by capitalism.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWhile there is so much interest during these earlier stages and so much opportunity, capitalists are focusing on speculation in a new token arriving in the market, or whether it's a utility token that has obvious transactional functions.&nbsp;  \\n\\nI believe that in a relatively short period of time, these speculative opportunities will be over, and people will build more valuable and enduring systems. We'll start to see blockchain flow into the mainstream more and more. I think it's already coming into the mainstream and you can see banks are starting to support it.&nbsp;\\n\\n####   \\n**What projects are you working on?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nI have an organization called Open Source Election (OSE) Systems. I care deeply about transparency and accountability in our election process. I care deeply about the democratic process as a whole. I don't feel that the systems we have in place or that we've had in place since 2004 at least, have anything to do with transparency.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWe've got 350 million people living in the United States--about 150 million who vote. That's a lot of votes. We want to be able to track that information and we want to be able to support democracy.  \\n\\nI\u2019m also interested in getting technology into the hands of people who don\u2019t have access to it. For example, there is a great need for technology in the Niger Delta. And it should be there. Nigeria has a lot of people who are coding. There's a lot of technology in Nigeria, but not necessarily in the Delta and in the rural areas.&nbsp;  \\n\\nWe should get that technology out there, so more people can access it.\\n\\n####   \\n**Don\u2019t Miss the Latest Akash News**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nJoin [our Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest Akash Network and Akash Token (AKT) announcements.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Announcing Akash Advisor Brian Fox, Creator of Bash Shell&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;If you\u2019ve ever used the GNU Bash, GNU Makeinfo, GNU Info, GNU Finger, GNU Echo, or GNU Emacs, chances are, you\u2019ve heard of open source pioneer and innovator Brian Fox and have leveraged his ubiquitous and valuable open source contributions.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Team&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Team&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.ZruUsuTd.jpg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,660],&quot;height&quot;:[0,480],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/announcing-akash-advisor-brian-fox-creator-of-bash-shell/banner-image.jpg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-rewards-overview/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-rewards-overview&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nLast Thursday, we shared a teaser of [The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser/), the third and final phase of our incentivized testnet.\\n\\nInspired by ecosystem projects from our partners and friends, such as Cosmos Game of Stakes, Solana Tour de Sol, and Kava Founder Rewards, The Akashian Challenge enables you to explore our decentralized cloud and help us strengthen and secure our platform.\\n\\n**With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) in rewards, and validators and developers joining from around the world, The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations will test your technical and social cunning through a series of tasks and open-ended challenges that get progressively more difficult.**\\n\\n**Ready to get started?!

our Mainnet 1 launch and IEO on BitMax last month, we achieved key milestones to secure the Akash Network and achieve liquidity for Akash Token (AKT), developing a strong foundation for our platform.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn parallel, our Engineering and Product teams have accelerated platform functionality in preparation for The Akashian Challenge: Phase 3 Testnet, and Mainnet 2, soon after, to materialize Akash DeCloud.\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to launch our biweekly _Developing Decloud_ Product Update to share more about the development of our platform and products with you.\\n\\n####   \\n**Akash DeCloud Development Update**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\n**Improved Bid Pricing**\\n\\nPreviously, a provider was only able to specify their bid pricing based on the memory requested for a given job. This worked as a proof of concept, and for internal and small scale testing, but we need a more robust pricing configuration system for real world applications.&nbsp;\\n\\nProviders [can now set](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/904) pricing based on parameters such as CPU count, storage capacity, and endpoints!\\n\\n  \\n**Support for TCP &amp; UDP**\\n\\nUntil now, Akash only supported client traffic via the HTTP application protocol on port 80. HTTP supports virtual host routing which enables routing to multiple endpoints or tenants. However, Akash must support non-HTTP traffic and different protocols, and route to the appropriate tenant applications.&nbsp;\\n\\nAn Akash endpoint consists of two components, a host name or IP address, and a unique port chosen at random. [This enables routing](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/904) to multiple unique application endpoints for a deployment, and allows users to choose which transport protocol the ingress router needs to support, either TCP or UDP.\\n\\n  \\n**Audited Attributes**\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been working on a system called \u201c[Audited Attributes](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/pull/905)\u201d, which will allow users deploying applications to be more selective about which providers can run their apps. Anyone on the Akash blockchain can assign these attributes to Providers via an on-chain transaction.\\n\\nBut the goal is for reputable persons or companies to be able to vouch for Providers by assigning them these audited attributes, and users can select Providers whose attributes fit their deployment needs.  \\n\\n  \\n**Preparation for The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Testnet**\\n\\nTo prepare for the upcoming [The Akashian Challenge Phase 3](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser/) testnet, we\u2019re progressing a number of features including Audited Attributes, and implementation of the long-awaited Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC), which spans across the entire Cosmos ecosystem.\\n\\n####   \\n**Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Development Update**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Typed Events**\\n\\n[Typed events have been merged](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer/pull/324) upstream on the Cosmos SDK and work has begun on the relayer implementation. This fix makes it easier for clients to consume events from all Cosmos SDK-based chains. These include active validator set changes, delegations, governance proposals, and other chain specific events.&nbsp;\\n\\nWhen you\u2019re watching new blocks show up on a block explorer, for example, these are events, and previously the code to implement them was complex and unruly. Typed events will make coding event-driven applications much simpler to write.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash pushed these changes to the Cosmos SDK, as we\u2019re maintaining three of these types of applications: the provider daemon, the relayer, and the deploy daemon.  \\n\\n  \\n**API Server**\\n\\n[We\u2019ve also started work](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer/pull/323) on the API server. Presently, the relayer functions only via the command line interface, meaning there is no way to programmatically interact with it besides writing bash scripts against the command line tool. This work allows the relayer to expose an RPC server that enables a user to make common queries and use all the relayer functionality against a programmatic HTTP interface, i.e. a website.&nbsp;\\n\\nUnder the contract we have with the Interchain Foundation (ICF), one of the deliverables for the relayer is to expose this functionality via a REST interface. This will allow for remote management of relayer nodes.\\n\\n  \\n**Testnets**\\n\\nIBC has gone through major security audits, and is currently undergoing final preparations for the v1.0 release, which is a part of Cosmos SDK v0.40. Alongside this release, there will be v1.0 of the relayer, which functions as the secure bridge between IBC compatible chains.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo ensure compatibility, there will be a number of upcoming testnets that will connect multiple validator testnets between a number of ecosystem organizations including Akash, Agoric, Cosmos, and CosmWasm!\\n\\n####   \\n**What\u2019s Next?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n*   Hands-on testing and bug fixing, including documenting and addressing possible workflow improvements\\n    \\n*   Reviewing and supporting a security audit.\\n    \\n*   Preparing for Testnet v3: documentation, guides, examples.  \\n      \\n    \\n\\n####   \\n**Don\u2019t Miss the Latest Akash Network Product Updates**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nJoin our [Discord dev](https://discord.akash.network) chat for technical support and information.\\n\\nJoin our [Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest Akash Network platform, product, and Akash Token (AKT) updates and announcements.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash Network Product Update: Developing DeCloud&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;With our Mainnet 1 launch and IEO on BitMax last month, we achieved key milestones to secure the Akash Network and achieve liquidity for Akash Token (AKT), developing a strong foundation for our platform.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Updates&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Adam Bozanich&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.UAFgyu2-.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1600],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1200],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-network-product-update-developing-decloud/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;As the world\u2019s first decentralized peer-to-peer cloud computing marketplace, our vision is to materialize a permissionless, sovereign, and open cloud where architects and builders have greater freedom to expand the human experience.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability, we\u2019ve leveraged a series of testnets that started with our Founding Member Challenge in Q4 2019, and continued with the launch of The Akashian Challenge Incentivized Testnet Phase 1 in Q2 2020.\\n\\n####   \\n**Results from The Akashian Challenge Launch in Q2 2020**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nThe Akashian Challenge launched in Q2 2020 and quickly became the second largest testnet in the Cosmos Hub since the Game of Stakes, with 99 active validators participating.\\n\\nThrough The Akashian Challenge, we tested governance and voting, and improved the process for network upgrades that strengthened our platform. These explorations have given us critical insights on how to build a healthy and vital community for growth and lead to a successful launch of our Mainnet 1 with full validator set of 64 mining blocks from Genesis.\\n\\nDuring Phase 1, our testnet withstood an AWS outage that brought down the centralized cloud (and a good portion of the internet), further validating market need for a _decentralized_ cloud. Our testnet also weathered a massive [zero fee transaction](https://medium.com/@novysf/the-outcome-from-akash-testnet-zero-fee-transaction-attack-5fd4aaa68d97) attack.\\n\\nWe were thrilled to see the massive community support and collaboration that occurred in Phase 1 and Phase 2, and we\u2019re grateful to our early Akashian Challenge participants for helping us build the foundation for a stronger network.\\n\\n####   \\n**What\u2019s Next: The Akashian Challenge Phase 3**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWe invite you to join us in the final stage of exploration, Phase 3: Developer Operations!\\n\\nWith 500,000 AKT in rewards, you\u2019ll need to leverage your technical and social prowess to maneuver your way to victory.&nbsp;  \\n\\n**The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations will launch on Monday, November 30th at 1700 UTC / 9:00AM PST. Phase 3 will encompass two weeks of challenges.**  \\n\\nPhase 3 Goals:\\n\\n*   Test platform functionality for Mainnet 2\\n    \\n*   Distribute tokens to potential users for Mainnet 2\\n    \\n*   Build a catalog of applications (SDLs) to launch Mainnet 2\\n    \\n\\nPhase 3 will accelerate our vision for a decentralized and open cloud computing marketplace, serving as the launchpad for Mainnet 2. Users will be able to lease compute for deploying applications.\\n\\n  \\n**Performance Improvements from Cosmos SDK v0.40**  \\n\\nWith the upgrade to [Cosmos SDK v0.40](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.40.0-rc0), also known as Stargate, there will be a number of performance enhancements to the testnet. The most notable improvement in Phase 3 will be the migration to Protobuf, which will increase transaction throughput and decrease the amount of data being sent between nodes.&nbsp;\\n\\nOther upgrades shipping with Stargate include state sync, full featured light clients, and support for the first standardized protocol for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)!&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**Application Deployments**  \\n\\nWith Phase 3, users can deploy web-based cloud applications -- such as static sites and API servers -- most common DeFi application components.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing and rewarding deployment of innovations like stateless or \u201cstate light\u201d blockchain applications; these are self-bootstrapping and have light storage requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nDeploying a blockchain node on our network will be one of the premier use cases, and will provide dApp developers an alternative to expensive and inflexible cloud provider services such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Even though Akash can support data-intensive full nodes, the scope of this testnet is limited to functionality tests and does not include stress tests.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe respectfully ask our community to refrain from deploying full-nodes for now as we have limited computing capacity.\\n\\n  \\n**Schedule**  \\n\\nPhase 3 of The Akashian Challenge will launch on Monday, November 30th, 2020 and run for two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**Rewards**  \\n\\nTo incentivize participation, 500,000 AKT will be distributed as Phase 3 rewards. Developers can build on the testnet and earn tokens by deploying applications. Validators can earn tokens by completing challenges and supporting the network.&nbsp;\\n\\nThere will be opportunities to earn additional rewards outside of deployment challenges.\\n\\n  \\n**How to Get Started**  \\n\\nStay tuned, as we\u2019ll be announcing information on how to participate, as well as a more detailed task and rewards schedule, next Wednesday November 18th.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n**Don\u2019t Miss Critical Phase 3 Updates**  \\n\\nJoin our [Discord dev](https://discord.akash.network/) chat for technical support and information.  \\n\\nJoin our [Telegram](https://t.me/AkashNW) for the latest Akash Network and AKT announcements.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 Teaser&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As the world\u2019s first decentralized peer-to-peer cloud computing marketplace, our vision is to materialize a permissionless, sovereign, and open cloud where architects and builders have greater freedom to expand the human experience.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Testnets&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Testnets&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Ryan Sumpter&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.keHEg-Vt.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,2000],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1500],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-to-transition-from-lunie-to-cosmostation-wallet/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-network-to-transition-from-lunie-to-cosmostation-wallet&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;With our Mainnet 1 launch and IEO on BitMax in the past month, we\u2019ve progressed key milestones to secure our network and achieve liquidity for Akash Token (AKT).

On Akash Network, AKT holders stake AKT to secure the Akash PoS network and in exchange earn rewards.&nbsp;  \\n    a. In the early days of the network, when meaningful income is not yet realized from network utilization, stakers earn ~54% APR rewards from inflation (new tokens minted).  \\n    b. The ~54% APR staking reward starts accruing at Mainnet 1 launch.  \\n    c. This APR is subject to change as we aim to lower inflation as the network matures. We will likely submit the first governance proposal change to this before the end of October 2020.  \\n      \\n    \\n2.  On September 25th, BitMax announced our IEO on the same day our Mainnet 1 launched.&nbsp;The circulating supply at the Genesis block was 2.8M AKT with 54% APR as staking rewards announced, as reflected in BitMax promotions that day.  \\n      \\n    \\n3.  To provide more information to prospective investors, we launched and announced our [AKT Token mini-site](https://akash.network/token/) with our unlock schedule included.  \\n      \\n    \\n4.  On October 16th, when our listing went live on BitMax (Block #284,500), our total token in circulation of 5,651,695 AKT included 2,800,000 AKT unlocked at Genesis and 2,851,695 AKT from accrued Staking Rewards.  \\n      \\n    \\n5.  As of today (Block #342,312), we have a total of 6,239,818 AKT in circulation, including 2,800,000 AKT unlocked at Genesis and 3,439,818 AKT from accrued Staking Rewards.&nbsp;  \\n      \\n    \\n6.  **As of this post's writing (Block #342,467), Akash has a staking ratio of 85.10%, meaning 88.03M of AKT is locked up for at least 21 days:**  \\n    a. Akash has one of the highest bonding ratios in the Proof-of-Stake and highest in the Cosmos Ecosystem.  \\n    b. For comparison, Band Protocol has an 81.28% staking ratio, and Kava has a 73.93% staking ratio.\\n    \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620926168-nanqvfcmj91247hjwcy6uuuoqtehr2cvffglssuxhwj5nytslue37mfqt4tauvwr2ofrkcd2ujms3ugbw-5x9ugz4vtuuusvljs6bgcy5jzakh3onuko2myk4vqlls12-cqbuz.png)\\n\\n#### **How We\u2019ll Improve Our Communications About AKT**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nGoing forward, we are committed to ensuring clearer communications and education around our token economics:  \\n  \\n\\n*   We\u2019ve updated our [AKT Token mini-site](https://akash.network/token/) to include a more dynamic and detailed unlock and circulating supply schedule for your reference.\\n    \\n\\n*   We\u2019ll also provide and share a biweekly token supply and rewards update from our CFO Cheng Wang, on [The Unstoppable Blog](https://akash.network/blog/).\\n    \\n\\n*   For those new to staking, we\u2019ll be releasing a guide on how to stake your AKT and earn our generous token rewards.\\n    \\n\\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, we couldn\u2019t have achieved our Mainnet 1 and BitMax IEO milestones without your support.

Founded by passionate engineers, blockchain evangelists, and entrepreneurs, SNZ has a long track record of supporting disruptive technologies to accelerate a new era of decentralized applications.\\n\\nWith a shared vision for leveraging blockchain to expand organizational and human experience, Akash Network is proud to welcome SNZ as valued validators and investors.\\n\\nRecently, we had the opportunity to connect with Kai of SNZ to chat about projects that have been on his radar and his insights on blockchain\u2019s influence on the ways we collaborate.&nbsp;  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925197-kai3-300x300.png)\\n\\n  \\n**What did the beginnings of SNZ look like, and how has it grown since then?**\\n\\nIn the early days, we are in search of promising projects, teams, and partnerships, so we are early investors of projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Dfinity, Polkadot, MakerDAO, and Brave. We believe that blockchain will usher in a new era of decentralized information technology that may change human history fundamentally. We see the coexistence of risks and opportunities and are relentlessly building the SNZ hub with kindred spirits and co-religionists through ups and downs in anticipation of that era.\\n\\n  \\n**SNZ was founded by a group of individuals, ranging from engineers and blockchain evangelists, with deep roots in the crypto community. How has your knowledge and experience influenced your investment process?**\\n\\nOur team\u2019s strong technical background has allowed us to explore the fundamental technologies and infrastructures of blockchain at length, diving deeply into the analysis and research behind it. Thanks to this, in the early days we understood that cross-chain was a vital technology, which prompted us to invest in Polkadot and Cosmos.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn recent years, our expertise also led us to invest in public chain, encryption, and other technologies.&nbsp;\\n\\nBased on our knowledge and research, we have our own framework of how the ecosystem will grow, as well as what the internal and application needs of blockchain will be. For instance, if blockchain were a tree, we wouldn\u2019t just want to invest in the foundational roots and trunk, we\u2019d want to invest in the totality of the tree -- including the applications of what the roots and trunk can produce -- its branches and leaves.&nbsp;  \\n\\n  \\n**How do you select what projects to partner with, and what drew you to work with Akash?**&nbsp;\\n\\nWe invest a lot in the public chain side. Public chain is more like a platform, and the success of the platform is dependent on how the ecosystem is growing on the platform.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash is one of the important projects within the Cosmos ecosystem, which piqued our interest. Decentralized cloud is ultimately going to be the future, which is why we also decided to invest in other projects like Dfinity.&nbsp;\\n\\nAkash building the decentralized marketplace for the decentralized cloud is potentially a very important project. Based upon these two concepts, we believe that Akash is a great project with a bright future worth investing in.  \\n\\n  \\n**What blockchain/crypto sectors or types of projects are you currently excited about, and why?**\\n\\nBesides supporting the ecosystem, which is always exciting for us, decentralized finance (DeFi) is still hot, and there are a lot of interesting things happening in the DeFi track that keep it moving.&nbsp;\\n\\nLooking beyond DeFi, there is growing buzz surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFT), as well as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). From the technical side, we\u2019re also interested in privacy preserving computation.&nbsp;\\n\\nWhat excites me about these projects is the differing logic behind them -- for example, DAO is one of the ultimate applications of blockchain. DAO enables blockchain\u2019s potential to enrich and diversify the way people collaborate with one another.\\n\\nNFT has a large range of applications, extending from the weather and gaming, to assets and finance.&nbsp;\\n\\nPrivacy preserving computation is a hot topic. The concerns about Facebook leaks and people\u2019s privacy are ever-present. With blockchain and encryption, there is open data that we can verify to preserve the privacy of those individuals.\\n\\n  \\n**How do you envision blockchain changing the world?**\\n\\nTwo years ago, a famous investor and friend of mine said something to me that I remember to this day: The biggest social activity of mankind is trading and blockchain technology consolidates this social activity.&nbsp;\\n\\nTo echo what I spoke about in regards to DAO, we believe that blockchain will evolve the way we collaborate. For example, today there are lots of collaborations requiring a middle man or trust organization, but in the future of blockchain, we only need trust within the code and math.  \\n\\n  \\n**If you had the opportunity to give advice to your younger self as he starts venturing into the world of blockchain, what would it be?**\\n\\nI would tell myself, simply, to invest earlier. Embrace and believe in the technology, and dive right in.  \\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n**To get the latest news on Akash partnerships, products, and promotions**\\n\\n#### [**Join The Unstoppable Cloud**](https://t.me/AkashNW)  \\n[  \\n](https://t.me/AkashNW)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;SNZ Joins Akash Network\u2019s Unstoppable Cloud&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Based out of China, one of the largest global centers for crypto, SNZ progresses their mission to empower blockchain projects, through their SNZ hub - a network of global top tier venture capitalists, state-of-the art blockchain technologies, and diverse crypto communities.

Akash enables any data center and anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace. Akash\u2019s DeCloud is the first decentralized cloud and vertically integrated solution that increases scalability and security, and the best price performance for DeFi, in the market.&nbsp;\\n\\nKava Labs has built the first cross-blockchain and multi-asset lending platform that allows users to collateralize a multitude of crypto assets in exchange for a loan in the form of Kava\u2019s stablecoin USDX.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn Q2 2020, Akash Network launched The Akashian Challenge Incentivized Testnet, which, to date, has attracted 211 teams and 99 active validators, making it one of the largest Testnets in the Cosmos Hub and one of the largest active Testnets globally. Akash will launch Mainnet 1 on Friday, September 25th, 2020, followed by Phase 3 of The Akashian Challenge.\\n\\nIn Q3 2020, Akash announced a partnership with Cosmos\u2019s Interchain Foundation to accelerate development of the Inter-Blockchain Communication interoperability protocol. For crypto and blockchain, where interoperability and composability are essential to continued growth for decentralized sectors like DeFi, IBC is the most promising and production-ready solution.&nbsp;\\n\\n####   \\n**About Akash Network**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAkash Network is developing the world\u2019s first and only decentralized cloud computing marketplace, enabling any data center and anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace. As the first decentralized cloud for DeFi, Akash DeCloud greatly accelerates scale and price performance for DeFi, decentralized organizations, and high-growth industries like machine learning/AI. Through Akash\u2019s platform, developers can easily and securely access cloud compute at a cost ten times lower than the current market providers (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure). The platform achieves these benefits by integrating advanced containerization technology with a unique staking model to accelerate adoption.\\n\\n####   \\n**About Kava**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nKava is the first decentralized hub for cross-chain DeFi applications and services. Kava\u2019s platform operates like a decentralized bank for digital assets connecting users with products like stablecoins, loans, and interest bearing accounts so that they can do more and earn more with their digital assets. Developers, applications, and financial institutions can integrate Kava\u2019s open platform to connect their users with Kava\u2019s suite of decentralized financial products and services.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash to Integrate Kava Labs's USDX&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Today, we\u2019re excited to announce an integration with Kava, the first cross-blockchain DeFi platform, to enable Kava\u2019s stablecoin USDX as the first coin for fee settlement on Akash\u2019s DeCloud platform.

The industry, and our team at Akash, has tried many different approaches to solving this problem.&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**Three Approaches to the Blockchain Scalability Problem**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nOne approach that a number of blockchain projects are taking to expand blockchain scalability is to develop faster databases with hardware, and increase transactions per second (TPS). However, there are limits to the scalability of individual computers, which in turn limits the scalability of chains that rely on individual computers. Another approach is to shard the blockchain. This approach is technically complicated, and there are many well funded teams working on it with little to show in terms of production systems.  \\n  \\nWith both these approaches, there are still unsolved technical problems, no working implementations, and solutions are at least a year away from deployment.  \\n\\nThere is a third approach, called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), led by Cosmos Network\u2019s non-profit Interchain Foundation, that solves the scalability problem by enabling different blockchain protocols to communicate and transact with each other independently.&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**Inter-Blockchain Communication and Interoperability**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nThe proposed IBC standard provides a framework to connect the global economy to the blockchain, and parties on existing blockchains will be able to interact and exchange with each other across chains.  \\n\\nIn development for over three years, IBC is the flagship feature of the Cosmos Network. For crypto and blockchain, where interoperability and composability are essential to continued growth for decentralized sectors like DeFi, IBC is the most promising and production ready solution.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe ability to transact quickly across chains will be transformational for the industry.  \\n\\nSo much so that Polkadot and Ethereum 2 are working to adopt IBC and join the broader interchain system.&nbsp;\\n\\n  \\n**Akash Partnership with Interchain Foundation**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nIBC will underlie the next generation of blockchain protocols. It\u2019s no secret that Akash has been [a committed proponent of Cosmos Network and Tendermint](https://akash.network/blog/decentralized-serverless-computing-coming-to-cosmos/). We were early believers in Cosmos and Tendermint\u2019s mission, technology, and community, and intentionally built our decentralized cloud marketplace with Cosmos SDK.  \\n\\nToday, we\u2019re thrilled to announce that Akash Network is solidifying an essential position in the Cosmos ecosystem through partnership with the Interchain Foundation. We\u2019re partnering with ICF to accelerate development of the IBC interoperability protocol.  \\n  \\nWith the ICF, we\u2019ll be working on the leading edge of research, deploying live production systems to make IBC a reality. The ICF has awarded Akash with a grant to maintain and build the relayer for IBC. Critical to launching the protocol, the relayer is the user interface that will enable all transfers and transactions on IBC. It is the only way users will initially be able to use IBC.  \\n\\nIBC development has a legacy at Akash. As former Head of Product at Cosmos/Tendermint, I worked with Iqlusion founder Zaki Manian on Game of Zones, IBC\u2019s successful testnet implementation.

In my view, there are two main reasons why DeFi will take prominence in finance:\\n\\n**1) Atomic Composability for Endless Possibilities**\\n\\nAtomic Composability enables developers to build programs that work across multiple protocols that perform a series of actions in a single transaction, wherein if any of the actions in that transaction were to fail, all the prior actions will revert back to the original state they were in before the transaction began.\\n\\nThis property is referred to as \u201catomicity\u201d and is common in modern databases, particularly in blockchain based systems (blockchain is a state machine).\\n\\nThis presents amazing opportunities that were not possible in traditional finance. One intriguing application of Atomic Composability is \u201cFlash Loans\u201d.\\n\\nUsing Flash Loans, one can borrow at a very high leverage, make a trade (usually an arbitrage), and pay back the loan in the same transaction. As the system knows how much profit one can make from the trade (since it's on blockchain), the loan is guaranteed by a smart contract.\\n\\nFlash Loans enable hyper-efficient money markets because they can effectively crush any arbitrage opportunities.\\n\\nFor a salient example, the trader in the tweet below walked out with $46k in profits from a $6k investment. How? By taking a margin loan at 16x leverage on DyDx to conduct an arbitrage trade on Ethereum between two decentralized exchanges. While lucrative in the early days of the market, arbitrage opportunities diminish as the networks mature, especially in DeFi because of its openness and composability.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620925254-screen-shot-2020-09-06-at-6-34-27-pm-711x1024.png)\\n\\n**2) Permissionless and Open Systems for HyperScale Adoption**\\n\\nPermissionless enabled the Internet to reach the scale it\u2019s at today. Even though permissioned models (AOL) gained traction in the early days of the Internet, a permissionless model fueled by the web browser (Netscape and Mozilla) and hypertext protocol (HTTP over TCP) was key for the Internet to reach the adoption it has today.\\n\\nThere is no question that a permissionless system would do the same for finance.\\n\\nThere is no signup on DeFi and no one can stop you from using DeFi.\\n\\nFinance is on the brink of a revolution, and permissionless systems are leading the charge.\\n\\n####\\n\\n**Current State of DeFi**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThe way I see it, there are four major stakeholders in DeFi and they can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n- **Retail Users**: Regular users using DeFi for trading, borrowing etc.\\n- **Traders**: Traders that usually trade on a daily basis and are technically competent.\\n- **Protocol Developers:** Software developers that design and build various protocols that make DeFi happen.\\n- **Validators**: Blockchain node operators that secure the blockchain that DeFi protocols use.\\n\\nThese stakeholders currently face a distinct set of challenges and risks including:\\n\\n**Censorship Risk**\\n\\nA rising trend with the DeFi boom are Stateless (such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) or [Aave](https://app.aave.com)) interfaces.&nbsp;  \\nand [online apps for real money](https://aussielowdepositcasino.com/real-money-casino-apps/).\\n\\nThese interfaces improve user experience exponentially while ensuring sovereignty, but risk censorship as they are hosted on a centralized platform with a DNS name.\\n\\nWhile the protocols themselves are censorship resistant, the interfaces are not.\\n\\nAdditionally, Stateless static interfaces are extremely limiting since they are executed on the client (versus a server, which is common). Overburdening the client for computational resources (for shared features) leads to poor user experience.\\n\\nCensorship resistance for user interfaces is critical to ensure DeFi is resilient.\\n\\n**Prohibitive Costs**\\n\\nDeFi users incur two types of costs. The Take Fee (usually a percentage of the trade charged by the protocol) and a Gas Fee (charged to validators that maintain the blockchain).\\n\\nTo swap assets, protocols such as Uniswap charge a 0.03% Take Fee, which is significantly lower than their centralized counterparts. This Take Fee is then distributed back to the liquidity providers as an incentive to build the order book liquidity. As of the writing of this article, the [ETH-USDT](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100daf4d40471f1852) market pair has the largest liquidity on Uniswap and provides a healthy 45% APY return to its liquidity providers.\\n\\nThe Gas Fees, however, are paid to blockchain maintainers, usually referred to as Validators or Miners, as an incentive for maintaining the security of the blockchain.\\n\\nUsers paid $7,830,064 per day in [Gas Fee](https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/) to Ethereum miners with a median cost per transaction currently at $6.40. These prohibitive Gas Fees are due to enormous hosting fees charged by the centralized cloud providers that the validator community depends on for running their nodes.\\n\\nIt is estimated that over [60% of Ethereum](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/09/23/ethereum-nodes-cloud-services-amazon-web-services-blockchain-hosted-decentralization/) nodes currently run on Amazon Web Services. This centralization not only leads to increased costs due to constrained supply but is also at risk of being centralized and prone to censorship.\\n\\nHigh gas costs prevents DeFi from being more accessible to the wider retail market.\\n\\n**Scalability Challenges**\\n\\nThe high transaction costs are indicative of the scalability challenges blockchain protocols face today. Ethereum blockchain currently supports around 15 transactions per second (TPS), which is prohibitive for smaller transactions and impossible to build high volume money markets (such as high margin trading).\\n\\nNew and promising blockchains such as Solana boast an impressive 50,000 TPS but have limited ecosystem support compared to Ethereum.\\n\\nCommon challenges node operators for new blockchains face are increasing costs and the centralized nature of the cloud service providers, which in turn increase gas costs.\\n\\nIncreasing costs limit validators\u2019 resources and ability to scale their operations to meet demand in a cost-efficient way.\\n\\n####\\n\\n**Decentralized Cloud for Decentralized Finance**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nA permissionless and decentralized cloud infrastructure is imperative to ensuring DeFi remains sovereign and becomes more accessible.\\n\\nDecentralized cloud networks such as Akash and Storj not only provide viable alternatives to centralized cloud providers, but also address DeFi\u2019s challenges in the following ways:\\n\\n**Unstoppable DeFi**\\n\\nCloud applications hosted on Akash are censorship resistant, meaning the applications can be controlled only by the owner of the key-pair.\\n\\nThis ensures that Stateless interfaces and the underlying node infrastructure to support them, are not at the mercy of centralized cloud providers.\\n\\nIn other words, Akash makes DeFi [unstoppable](https://news.bitcoin.com/decentralizing-the-web-handshake-akash-and-the-quest-for-censorship-resistance).\\n\\n**Lower Costs**\\n\\nAkash taps into underutilized cloud capacity across millions of data centers around the world. An estimated 85% of global cloud capacity remains unused today.\\n\\nAt Akash, users set the price they\u2019re willing to pay and the network optimizes for the lowest cost possible for the application to function. Along with a novel subsidy model, this pricing mechanism is projected to reduce cloud computing costs 3x to 15x.\\n\\nNot only can Layer 1 validators who switch to Akash get significantly better price-performance, but it enables them to stay decentralized.\\n\\nAdditionally, DeFi developers and technical traders can leverage lower costs on Akash for hosting full nodes to bot infrastructure.\\n\\nLower cloud costs result in lower fees, which benefits the ecosystem as a whole.\\n\\n**Increased Scalability**\\n\\nAkash\u2019s permissionless model enables anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider, unlocking 85% of underutilized cloud computing capacity in 8.4 million data centers around the world\\n\\nOn Akash, developers have unlimited access to all network resources at any time--thus removing barriers to scalability.\\n\\n####\\n\\n**What's Next?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAt Akash, we\u2019re building the first DeCloud for DeFi, and making DeFi developer challenges a thing of the past.\\n\\nAkash DeCloud is a vertically integrated solution that enabless developers to deploy interfaces and nodes without friction, and with the best price-performance in the market.\\n\\nIf you are a validator or developer, we invite you to participate in the Akash DeCloud Early Access Program.\\n\\n#### [**Join Akash DeCloud Early Access Program** \u2192 ](https://akashnet.typeform.com/to/UImjD7bs)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash DeCloud for DeFi&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Finance\u2014an industry that is expected to reach $26.5 trillion by 2020\u2014is being disrupted at an atomic speed by its degenerate cousin, decentralized finance or simply DeFi.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Greg Osuri&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.y3V1uZlk.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,896],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1290],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/akash-decloud-for-defi/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;partner-profile-dacm/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;partner-profile-dacm&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n> _\\&quot;We were excited about Greg and team\u2019s experience and knowledge of the market--even down to customer-by-customer granularity. We like to invest in teams that can build great tech but just importantly help drive usage of it. The Akash team\u2019s knowledge and passion for what they are building made the decision for us.\\&quot;_ **\u2014 Richard Galvin, CEO**\\n\\nWe are proud to introduce DACM as a valued partner of Akash, helping us bring our vision of an open, decentralized, and unstoppable cloud to the world. Since its inception 3 years ago, DACM has grown into a pre-eminent force in a burgeoning new asset class, accruing accolades for their performance, including&nbsp; 2019\u2019s #1 performing Crypto Fund by DAF Liquid Venture Fund.\\n\\nWe recently synced up with Richard Galvin, CEO of DACM, to gain insight into the firm\u2019s success, and to learn about his journey from Goldman and JPMorgan \u201cbankster\u201d to CEO of an award-winning global digital assets firm.\\n\\n**How did DACM start, and grow into what it is today?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nI worked in banking in Australia for 20 years at both Goldman and J.P. Morgan across both advisory and financing teams. For most of my career I was focused on the TMT sectors \u2013 Tech, Media and Telco. When I left banking I was looking for something very different, but also wanted it to utilise the things I had enjoyed the most over the last two decades \u2013 high-growth tech opportunities and financial markets. In the break I had after leaving banking, a good friend encouraged me to research Bitcoin and, in a familiar story to many, once I started reading, I never looked back.\\n\\nI started investing my own capital and fell for the pace, innovation and market-ecosystem \u2013 building out an investment management business focused on what I believe is the most exciting and disruptive tech of a generation was a compelling business prospect. However, a core understanding of the tech and connectivity with thought leaders, in what is still an opaque sector, was key, and the same friend who led me to Bitcoin introduced me to Gabriel Abed.\\n\\nGabe has been in the space for many years and has a cryptography background \u2013 it was clear immediately that our respective skill sets were complementary. We had the same perspectives on where digital asset technology was headed, and we both had the time to commit to growing what we wanted to be the leading investment manager for global institutional and family office investors.\\n\\nWe started building the business in early 2017, managing our first external capital in Q3 2017 and launching our first public fund, Digital Asset Fund in January 2018, our second fund, DAF Liquid Venture Fund in August 2018, and our third fund, a market-neutral derivatives-focused fund, DAF Greeks Fund in August 2019.\\n\\nDigital Asset Fund was the second best performing long-only crypto fund globally in 2019 and DAF Liquid Ventures was the top-performing VC crypto fund. It\u2019s exciting for the team that the vision we had in 2017 and the investment approach we have stayed true to, has helped see us through both bullish and bearish markets.\\n\\n**You are self-described reformed Goldman and JPMorgan bankster \u2014 I'd love to hear more about that. What was your experience like there, and what inspired you to go into the digital asset sector?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nI had a great career in investment banking. The pace and excitement of the work was both addictive coming straight out of university, as well as an incredible training ground through the inspiring senior bankers I worked for over my career, and my junior years in the training programs that the banks have in place.\\n\\nThe roles I kept being drawn to in the industry had two things in common \u2013 high-growth/tech oriented clients and interacting with financial markets \u2013 so when I was looking for the next opportunity, digital assets were the purest form of both those attributes I have yet found. I knew it was for me.\\n\\n**How has your experience at these firms informed your digital assets investments? What translates from that world, and what doesn\u2019t?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nYes \u2013 very much so. We lean heavily upon the core valuation and diligence practises learnt at those firms, and I believe it has helped us make better investment decisions for our funds. Staying true to these approaches has helped us cut through the noise that the crypto market, and all markets, create \u2013 continue to invest through bearish markets and don\u2019t get distracted by the hype and emotion that comes with strong bull markets.\\n\\nWhat doesn\u2019t work? Banking is, from my perspective, still a fast-moving industry but it's nothing compared to this sector. You need to adapt the speed of decision making dramatically in this sector or you will have a long list of missed opportunities and regrets!\\n\\n**What drew you to work with Akash?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWe actively run a number of nodes/validators for our portfolio companies and through this, and other business-related activities, we have become significant (for us at least) users of cloud computing services \u2013 it can get expensive! We have always seen this as a great use-case for crypto to disrupt but, until Akash, hadn\u2019t come across the right opportunity.\\n\\nThe core differentiators we saw for Akash were its understanding of the end-market, focus on re-setting the cost-curve, and simplifying the experience for users. The design leverages crypto at what it can be good at - bringing distributed resources together - but also minimises its involvement in what it traditionally hasn\u2019t been good at \u2013 UX.\\n\\nWe were excited about Greg and team\u2019s experience and knowledge of the market--even down to customer-by-customer granularity. We like to invest in teams that can build great tech but just importantly, help drive usage of it. The Akash team\u2019s knowledge and passion for what they are building made the decision for us.\\n\\n**What makes DACM different from other investors in the ecosystem?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nI can only speak for our own processes, but it is very focused on what I would classify as \u201ctraditional\u201d analytical methodologies \u2013 we utilise the experience our team has in detailed financial analysis and modeling as well as our experience in granular due-diligence to make what we believe are informed investment decisions.\\n\\nWe also ensure we make assessments of a project\u2019s entire value creation chain \u2013 not just the design and ability to build the tech, but the team\u2019s ability to build a community and manage the myriad stakeholders that are involved in a successful crypto project with a listed token.\\n\\nI believe this process, and sticking to it without exception, has not only helped us avoid a number of potential mistakes, but also to find differentiated opportunities that have been incredible investments for our funds.\\n\\n**Crypto is an idiosyncratic environment that\u2019s constantly evolving, and you\u2019ve established yourselves as experts at navigating it. How do you keep your finger on the pulse?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWe work very hard at building and maintaining global networks of both founders and investors to ensure we hear different perspectives and global news flow. Part of that is in running a decentralised team ourselves - we have team members in Australia, Southeast Asia, Middle East, and the Caribbean \u2013 which gives us great geographical coverage but, given the majority of information flows electronically, we also lead and participate in a broad range of online networks.\\n\\nWe encourage everyone on our team to be active members in these communities \u2013 both sharing and listening to perspectives.\\n\\n**I see that you\u2019re based out of Australia \u2014 what is the ecosystem like there, and how does it effect the way you invest?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nGrowing! It's been a great base for me personally \u2013 Australia has, what I believe, an enviable position in the world with strong business ties and networks through Asia alongside historical and language connectivity through the UK and US, which is invaluable in a truly global sector like this.\\n\\nThe local ecosystem is really coming into its own over the last 18 months with local teams or Australian founders - the key drivers of the DeFi revolution including sector leaders Synthetix, mStable, RenVM, dHedge and Thorchain.\\n\\n**How do you envision cryptocurrency changing the world?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWe have a high-level thesis that three key trends in the world are ongoing digitisation, decentralisation, and falling trust in traditional institutions. Whilst the third may be disappointing in some respects, we still believe these are likely multi-decade trends the world is facing. In our opinion, cryptocurrencies, and more broadly digital assets, have emerged at the perfect time - they are essential tools to help facilitate this change.\\n\\nGiven our team\u2019s background, the ability for this tech to disrupt and reshape the traditional financial sector has been a focus for us but the use-cases are broader than that and really only limited by innovators\u2019 ability to find instances where costs can be reset, and efficiencies generated.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Partner Profile: DACM&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We were excited about Greg and team's experience and knowledge of the market--even down to customer-by-customer granularity.

I left my role at the bank in search of new opportunities, and started trading stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ--I\u2019m still trading.\\n>\\n> At the end of 2017, my friends gave me a present--0.5 ETH and a wallet. That was the first cryptocurrency I got. I was so excited and started to learn more about blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, new blockchain projects, and decentralization. I started to research and trade crypto every day, and became a community moderator. It became my passion. Now I can\u2019t imagine my life without crypto, trading, and the crypto community.\\n>\\n> I believe that Akash is a game changer in the cloud computing industry. The project has a great vision of the future, a world where cloud computing is permissionless, sovereign, and open. I look forward to helping the team build that future.\\n\\n#### **Zavodil Reviews Akash Network**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nWith over 11,000 subscribers and hundreds of thousands of views, the [Zavodil](https://www.youtube.com/c/Zavodil/about) YouTube show is one of the most influential among Russian audiences.

We set out to test the performance of the Akash Network decentralized exchange (DEX).**\\n\\nWhat Phase 2 ended up testing was the performance of Tendermint and Cosmos SDK, surfacing well-known performance issues that constrained prior testnets, such as Game of Stakes and Game of Zones. In both GoS and GoZ, spam attacks took down significant portions of the network and caused service disruptions.\\n\\nAs a result of these issues, Akashians experienced a series of tesnet performance limitations during Week 1 and Week 2. We\u2019re grateful for all those who persevered and continued to push through.\\n\\nThe performance limitations the network is facing will be significantly reduced once the protobuf migration and other changes are released in 0.34 Tendermint and 0.40 Cosmos SDK. These releases are expected in the coming weeks, and can be tracked at the [Tendermint v0.34 Milestone](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/milestone/27) and [Cosmos SDK v0.40 Project Board](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/projects/38).\\n\\nWe\u2019ve already completed the initial work to integrate the new changes in preparation for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, and the network will benefit from improved performance and additional features. We\u2019ll also have full network functionality much sooner than we\u2019d previously anticipated.\\n\\n#### **The Close of The Akashian Challenge: Phase 2**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Due to these performance limitations and in preparation for integrating the new Tendermint and Cosmos SDK releases, we\u2019ll be closing the Phase 2 competition early, on 0000UTC / 5PM Friday, July 17th.** For Week 1 and Week 2, we\u2019ll be rewarding teams based on the original [Reward Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v5OxKfYE3yzJevg_oWNyRQ5vKci3lwTZcFpbTXQ_bBE/edit#gid=0).\\n\\n45,213 AKT in AKT rewards were budgeted for Week 3: Cast a Wide Net.

We\u2019ll be testing the user experience of our platform and refining application deployments on the network. Unlike Phase 2, we will not be testing the performance of the blockchain.\\n\\nSince Phase 2 has been focused on testing the on-chain aspects of our network, we\u2019ve been unable to showcase the non-blockchain progress that our engineering team has achieved.

Can a network be truly decentralized if it exists on a centralized cloud? Simply VC doesn\u2019t think so, and neither do we. That\u2019s why Simply VC runs all of their validator operations out of their own Tier 3 data center. That\u2019s also why we chose to partner with Simply to bring their capacity, validator operation, and vision to our cloud marketplace.\\n\\nAs one of Cosmos\u2019s genesis validators, Simply VC has supported the Cosmos ecosystem since its inception. With a veteran team of IT, Security, and blockchain specialists, Simply has been supporting decentralized networks such as Cosmos, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Kusama, for the last 6 years.\\n\\nWe recently connected with Simply VC CEO Matthew Felice Pace, CTO Isaac Zarb, and&nbsp; Blockchain Technology Analyst Daniel Magro, to discuss what makes Simply VC unique and how they envision the future of the decentralized web.\\n\\n**Tell us a little about yourselves and how you came to join Simply VC?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Daniel**: I take care of the Infrastructure and DevOps side of Simply VC. I also get involved in development.\\n\\n**Isaac**: I\u2019ve been in the IT industry for about 20 years and I\u2019ve been interested in IT since I was about 12 years old. I\u2019ve worked at ISPs, software companies, fintech companies, and consulting companies. I started in networking before moving to security. At Simply VC, I started as a subcontractor, and implemented security. I got into blockchain because the team was doing a lot of work around masternodes at the time. I became interested in proof of stake.\\n\\n**Matthew**: I\u2019d like to clarify one thing first. The VC in Simply VC is not venture capital--it stands for virtual currencies. The company was set up in 2015 by our founder who is now very much hands off. He set it up to mine bitcoin here in Malta, and then we met in 2018, technically to work on something else, and over time it evolved into blockchain. I was very interested beforehand. I have a computer science background, and was working towards a PhD that I didn\u2019t complete. I worked on&nbsp;data science, and became interested in blockchain around 2017.\\n\\nI knew about it before I read \u201cMastering Bitcoin\u201d in 2015. We were thinking about doing asset management, but shifted completely to just doing tech and delegated proof of stake. We got into Cosmos, and at launch, we were one of the genesis validators.\\n\\n**You\u2019re all from Malta--what in your opinion has made the island such a hot space in crypto?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Isaac**: I think it started from fintech about 10 years ago and igaming, internet gambling, and then there was a huge tech community. We have a large number of developers, and network and security guys. People wanted to work in tech and companies found it easy to recruit tech people. We speak english so that helps a lot. The weather is good. Companies come from Europe where the weather sucks.\\n\\n**Matthew**: There was a push to try and create a new industry on the island. Since it worked for igaming and fintech, the government decided to try and pitch Malta as blockchain island. They developed legal frameworks as there were very few that existed at the time. They were quite thorough and well designed. But there was a lot of hype. They joined with industry players to produce conferences and tried to get people, as they did with igaming, to move their base to Malta.\\n\\n**Blockchain technology is in a nascent stage. How did you develop the skills necessary to contribute at Simply VC Daniel?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Daniel**: I became interested in blockchain 6 or 7 years ago. Later on, Simply VC\u2019s CEO was recruiting at my university, and I\u2019ve been working at Simply VC ever since. I learned along the way. Each time I had a new project, I learned the skills necessary for the project, and over time, I gained holistic knowledge.\\n\\n**How did Simply VC form? Was Simply VC\u2019s vision always to help support the decentralization of the internet or did that develop over time?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Matthew**: I think it was always in the mind of our founder. In the beginning, we didn\u2019t really know where we were headed. This is why Daniel mentioned that you learn things as you go based on the project you\u2019re working on. I think that\u2019s the spirit.\\n\\n**Daniel**: Our founder is obsessed with decentralization. Decentralization was always a part of the vision.\\n\\n**Isaac**: I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware, but we have our own Tier 3 data center which we run our operations from, and we have colocated servers across Europe, and others in Malta. So we do not rely on the cloud at all because we believe that the internet and blockchain should be decentralized. So it doesn't really make sense if everything is running on Amazon or Google Cloud. Which _you_ must understand completely!\\n\\n**You said you have some colocated servers across Europe. What is the purpose of running them?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Isaac**: It\u2019s for sentries mostly, and high availability in case something happens to our node. We have another data center in Malta where we run other sentries which we can turn into validators if we have a complete outage. Malta is small so we could even move our HSMs if we wanted, to the other data center. We want to make sure we\u2019re highly resilient. If something happens, we could literally move the hardware from one place to the other, and everything is set up and can continue functioning quickly.\\n\\nWe actually simulate outages, and a week or two ago, we had maintenance going on in the data center. We missed a few blocks, but I was extremely happy that our main fiber optic link went down for maintenance and everything shifted over nicely. Our automation scripts work well--once you see it working when you need it, you really appreciate it.\\n\\n**It seems that having a background in IT and Security prepared you well for the needs of running a node for a blockchain--you really care about downtime.**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Isaac**: My experience working for ISPs enforces that downtime is bad. If you\u2019re an ISP and you have downtime, customers are going to complain and you\u2019re going to end up in the newspapers. I come from a background where all my services have to be online. I\u2019ve worked for digital terrestrial TV companies so downtime was impossible. You\u2019d have live football streaming and if you have a second of downtime, people would literally kill you, and come knock on your door!\\n\\n**Matthew**: Not any downtime--acceptable downtime. There\u2019s maintenance. Otherwise you would sacrifice security for no downtime. Security is paramount, and then downtime.\\n\\n**Do you feel that specializing early on in blockchain infrastructure has given Simply VC a competitive advantage to other data center operations stepping into the space? If so, why?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Matthew**: The space was very young, and when it moves so quickly, the earlier you can get in, the better. You get a competitive advantage because personal documentation for these processes have not been developed yet. You have to learn as you go and it\u2019s a matter of putting the hours in. Because everyone on the team was thrown into the deep end every time, it gave us the mental fortitude and clarity to move forward. It\u2019s very easy to get lost, but when you do it over and over, you learn. For example, I would say Daniel is a blockchain native. In the same way as people are internet native, which maybe my parents weren\u2019t.\\n\\n**You specialize in supporting decentralized networks. What complexities specific to those networks are the most challenging?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Isaac**: It doesn\u2019t make it more difficult--short block times make downtimes very important and high availability is more of an issue. With a blockchain, you have a reputation to keep and the agility of the protocol pushes you to be better. Blockchain software is actually less complex.\\n\\n**Matthew**: It\u2019s a little different because it\u2019s a community effort and adjustments happen as a group to identify the right parameters. The interesting thing that I see in blockchain is that it forces communication. In a centralized environment, communication breaks down very quickly because you can do things by yourself. You can silo yourself and do it alone.\\n\\nIt\u2019s alright to install and run a system but there are lots of potential issues upgrading a decentralized system. If you take Cosmos Hub for instance, the challenges that come from agreeing on what to upgrade because the software is decentralized is not something you have in a centralized system.\\n\\n**Being on the infrastructure side of things, where do you see the biggest need for growth in blockchain?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Daniel**: With something like Cosmos for example, you have the top 5 validators controlling around 32% of the network. I personally think that\u2019s a big problem.&nbsp;The network is set up such that it can be decentralized but the players that are in it force it not to be that way.\\n\\n**Matthew**: Apart from the growth of DeFi, it is concerning that we are building decentralized systems _assuming_ that they are going to be decentralized. We need to develop systems that enforce decentralization. It\u2019s the law of nature--if you can do it, you will do it.\\n\\n**Daniel, you\u2019ve been a very active member of The Akashian Challenge community, which we are incredibly thankful for. Could you share a highlight from your experiences with Phase 1 or 2 so far?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Daniel**: The proposal from Phase 1 was quite interesting for me. Lots of discussion and opinions from all members. I also liked the second proposal which was sort of a trick proposal. I enjoy all the new faces and that a lot of people new to the space joined. It's good to see new people getting involved. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what solutions people come up with to get the most bids and leases.\\n\\n**What kind of a rig are you running for the challenges?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Isaac**: For the validators, we\u2019re using a virtualized shared server of our own and for the workloads we have dedicated hardware which we prefer for the workloads. We tested out through the challenges, but at the moment, we\u2019re only using the virtualized solution. The difference between our hardware and cloud hardware is that&nbsp; we don\u2019t over provision our servers. We never go over 30% to 40% capacity whereas servers on the cloud could be over-provisioned by 20 to 30 times.\\n\\n**Daniel**: We\u2019re using 8 cores for our validator, 32 gb of ram (20 gb of ram to the provider operations), 200 gb hard drive. We have GPU servers ready to dedicate to Akash\u2019s mainnet.\\n\\n**What excites you about Akash?**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**Matthew**: Our vision is of a decentralized future and it has to start with Akash. In today\u2019s world, if we\u2019re going to move away from large conglomerates, which used to be good because they innovated, we\u2019re going to need tools like Akash. I\u2019m excited to partner.\\n\\n**Daniel**: Akash is exactly in line with our beliefs of truly decentralizing the cloud, and giving power back to the little guys. I believe it\u2019s the way forward.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Partner Profile: Simply VC&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We're excited to announce that we\u2019ve partnered with Simply VC to help us build the future of the decentralized cloud.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-07-16T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Partners&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Michael Gushansky&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.DHyrwi3M.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1998],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1458],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/partner-profile-simply-vc/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-boz-menzalji-general-manager/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;introducing-boz-menzalji-general-manager&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;Across every function at Akash, from engineering, to partnerships, to marketing, one Akashian has made a profound impact in the way we collaborate and scale.\\n\\nHe enables our team to relentlessly materialize the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud marketplace.\\n\\n**Today, we\u2019re thrilled to introduce Boz Menzalji, Akash\u2019s General Manager. Unshakably optimistic, curious, and empathetic, Boz is a problem solver with an irrepressible growth orientation. He is no stranger to the roller coaster of building a startup.**&nbsp;\\n\\nA serial entrepreneur and business development leader, Boz spent 13 years navigating the successes and failures of entrepreneurship. Prior to Akash, Boz saw two acquisitions and was GM at Refereum, a blockchain-based gaming rewards and marketing platform. Before that, he led business development for multiple SaaS startups in gaming, agtech, martech and fintech, including Paydici, a billing and payments platform.&nbsp;\\n\\nBoz and his family immigrated to Oregon from Lattakia, Syria, when he was young. His early experiences gave him an understanding of how economic and political constraints impact companies and innovation. He graduated from the University of Oregon in 2008 at the height of the recession.&nbsp;\\n\\nA knack for problem solving and an insatiable curiosity made him well-suited for the demands of building and growing startups across industries. This experience prepared him for the challenges and opportunities of building Akash.\\n\\n> I've always enjoyed solving problems, building things, and creating value -- entrepreneurship is one of my core passions. My capabilities in growth, business development, and partnerships grew out of an innately pragmatic and programmatic approach\\n\\n#### **Building the Market for the Decentralized Cloud**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nBefore he would agree to join full time, Boz started first as a consultant at Akash with one condition--to verify prospective customers\u2019 pain points.&nbsp;\\n\\n> After multiple meetings with companies, I quickly saw that they shared acute pain points, and there was a clear problem with a common denominator between everyone we spoke with. I saw that the problem was a massive one. 85%+ of servers are sitting idle around the world. Across 10+ million servers, that represents $30 billion of capital--incredibly wasteful. Compounding the issue is an oligopolized cloud services industry...change is needed, and the product, the time, and the market are aligned well for disruption.\\n\\nOver the first few months with Akash, Boz came to see CEO Greg Osuri as someone he\u2019d be willing to go to battle with every day.\\n\\n> What most people don't realize, is that the startup becomes your family. You\u2019ll fight and bump heads. You\u2019ll lose your cool. You\u2019ll cry. You\u2019ll celebrate wins and losses...and all of it will be _together_ because at the end of the day, you\u2019re one team. Period. Greg\u2019s core value for everything he does is _empathy_. That says quite a bit about who you\u2019re working with.\\n\\nAs Akash\u2019s General Manager, Boz leads fundraising, partnerships, business development, and operations. For Boz, sales is a company\u2019s lifeline and requires continual iteration from lead generation, to signed contract, to onboarding and customer success. That journey needs to be comprehensively understood and replicated to enable scale.\\n\\n> First, recognize that your sales process is an engine--make sure you know every moving part of your engine, and how it interacts with each other.  \\n>   \\n> Second, be ruthlessly focused on the customer by executing a root/cause analysis during your customer development initiatives; the _what_ is simple, but always ask the _why_. Don\u2019t build features that don\u2019t solve problems or add value - verify before you build. Do not repeat the timeless mistake of _build it and they will come_\\n> \\n> Third, think about moats and how to build them early on. Stay pragmatic and disciplined. Focus on one problem and solve it well, and stay laser focused on the shortest path to generating value at first (it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds). For an understanding of moats, I recommend Peter Thiel's Zero to One and Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne.\\n\\n#### **Growing the Dream Team**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nBoz\u2019s invaluable contributions beyond his role include clearing roadblocks for the team, establishing a collaborative culture, championing the happiness of our team, and ensuring we celebrate together.&nbsp;\\n\\nIn the past two quarters, Akash has doubled in team size. Boz has been involved in recruiting and hiring each new team member. At Akash, culture starts with empathy. Boz also looks for candidates with a deep sense of ownership and purpose.&nbsp;  \\n  \\nBut if empathy doesn\u2019t come with ownership and purpose, we don\u2019t make the hire.\\n\\n> Startups aren\u2019t your typical 9-5. You\u2019re going to share large milestones and deliverables. You have to care enough about your team to support them, and you\u2019ll need them to support you. Startups are family. I want to ensure our people grow alongside the company and share in the prosperity of the company\u2019s success.\\n\\nEmpathy impacts Akash\u2019s one metric that matters, which is total network spend on Akash\u2019s marketplace, or GMV (gross merchandise value).\\n\\n> We build our platform with empathy for the developer. We want to remove the cognitive tax it takes for developers to adopt Akash and deploy their applications.\\n\\n#### **Looking to the Future**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**  \\n\\nAfter launching our successful incentivized testnet competition, The Akashian Challenge, with 211 teams, and selling out the first production run of our Superminis,&nbsp; Boz is excited to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional markets, first with strategic partnerships, and customer development.\\n\\n> At Akash, I\u2019m excited about creating a new market category of edgeless cloud infrastructure, and leveraging blockchain to enable permissionless access to compute from anyone, anywhere.\\n\\nAn insatiable learner, Boz\u2019s core passion is space and like space, his desire to grow and push himself seems limitless. After completing consecutive cloud certifications, he\u2019s currently learning Bash/Shell and voraciously studying the rise of FinTech 2.0 (DeFi), which he believes will have tremendous implications for global markets.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing Boz Menzalji, General Manager&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Across every function at Akash, from engineering, to partnerships, to marketing, one Akashian has made a profound impact in the way we collaborate and scale.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Team&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Team&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.C_hkscRa.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,660],&quot;height&quot;:[0,480],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/introducing-boz-menzalji-general-manager/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-unstoppable-update-july-2020/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-unstoppable-update-july-2020&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\n**This past month was a month of acceleration for Akash**.

We\u2019re incredibly excited to have Cheng leverage his extensive financial and operational experience from Wall Street, to digital commerce and ensure Akash has healthy liquidity and scale to support our ambitious growth goals.**_\\n\\n\\\\- **Greg Osuri, CEO Akash Network**\\n\\nBuilding the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud marketplace requires a master level of organizational structuring and scaling, alignment, and growth planning.\\n\\nWe\u2019re thrilled to introduce our new CFO Cheng Wang. A savvy entrepreneur and operational leader, with finance chops from legendary firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Cheng has _unstoppable_ financial and operational capabilities to help us materialize the future of the cloud.\\n\\n> At Akash, I saw a massive opportunity to solve a universal problem with global impact on growth and innovation--escalating cloud costs. Akash provides faster, more efficient, and 10x lower cost access to the cloud.\\n\\n#### **From Debates, to Decentralized Cloud**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAs the son of immigrant parents with modest means, Cheng developed a precocious financial acumen early, approaching his future through an analytical cost-benefit perspective. His parents inculcated the importance of education and hard work. Growing up, Cheng\u2019s family did not have much.\\n\\nThis experience drove an early ambition and competitiveness that, combined with a keen mind, enabled Cheng to become a champion debater in high school and the recipient of a full scholarship to Macauley Honors College CUNY in New York.\\n\\nIf there is a person who exemplifies Akash\u2019s core value of sovereignty, that person is Cheng, in full control of his future outcomes. Although he had a knack for debate, and considered a career in law, his pragmatism led him to a fast-track career in finance. Accepted into a competitive internship at JP Morgan, Cheng quickly progressed across Wall Street\u2019s most renowned and storied firms, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch.\\n\\n> Earlier in my career, I found myself in political and hierarchical environments, and I was driven and focused on achievement. I learned important early lessons about leadership and culture. At Goldman Sachs, I found myself surrounded by incredibly intelligent problem solvers--I learned humility there.\\n\\nCheng later served as Vice President at Royal Bank of Scotland, focusing on debt and valuations. After 8 years at financial institutions, he transitioned his operational and financial acumen to entrepreneurship. He founded multiple retail businesses before relocating to California to serve as CFO for WRKSHP, a high growth San Francisco gaming startup.\\n\\nThe lure of blockchain brought him to Refereum, an incentivization platform built on blockchain, and the vision of the decentralized cloud and the experienced Akash team brought him, finally, to Akash Network.\\n\\n> Akash attracted me for several reasons--a highly experienced and talented team with an analytical and programmatic approach, a large market with a prevalent and ubiquitous need, and the opportunity to join at an early stage where I can actually impact growth and culture.\\n\\n#### **Pioneering Token Economics and Building Culture**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAt Akash, Cheng leads financial and operational strategy, forecasting, internal systems, and reporting, with a sharp eye on growth planning and treasury management to anticipate turbulence and opportunities in the market. His organizational and planning dexterity enables the company to weather multiple outcomes, especially in a global climate of uncertainty.\\n\\n> I\u2019m looking forward to managing the token market, ensuring token value, and engaging token holders and investors, as well as mitigating potential risks to the token and to the company. With Akash\u2019s pioneering token economics, we\u2019re implementing a system that hasn\u2019t been done in capital markets--that\u2019s exciting.\\n\\nOn treasury and growth management, an Achilles Heel that has felled many projects in the ecosystem, Cheng shares:\\n\\n> Building our markets along with our treasury is the on-going challenge for the foreseeable future. I look forward to helping us get in position to leverage our resources as optimally as possible. There are many companies with amazing opportunities, but squander their potential by mismanaging tokens, monetary capital, and human capital--that\u2019s not going to be us.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922423-cheng-pic.jpg)\\n\\n#### **Guiding Growth for the Decentralized Future of the Cloud**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nPropelled by controlling outcomes, and operating in a volatile global market, Cheng believes in growth planning and management, and proper funding to ensure more runway than is needed.\\n\\nHow will he help Akash achieve this?\\n\\n1. Build a strong, healthy, and durable market for Akash Token (AKT)\\n\\n2. Overall treasury and balance sheet management--maximizing our assets\\n\\n3. Proper organizational scaling\\n\\n> Projecting that forward, I have no doubt that our future constraints will not be growth, capital, or opportunities, but time, and timing. Regarding time, we\u2019ll have more to do and more to pursue than we actually have time for. We\u2019ll have to constantly choose between competing opportunities. And timing is equally as important--choosing when to do or not to do is just as important as determining if we should or shouldn\u2019t. We can sum this up as proper scaling.\\n\\nA financial strategist moved, not only by metrics, but by maximizing the health and happiness of teams, Cheng shares his perspective on culture:\\n\\n> Culture starts from the top with the founder. I\u2019m a firm believer that a company\u2019s culture and values aren\u2019t determined by some consultant or a set of books, but determined and propagated by the founder(s) and the management team. Its success or failure depends on its robustness, consistency, and clarity. Every single individual matters immensely in building the right organization. As individuals, we\u2019re taught to believe in who we are--why shouldn\u2019t companies and teams?\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing Cheng Wang&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Cheng is one of the most creative, curious, and articulate thinkers in the world of finance.

We\u2019re seeing more of the ways we connect and collaborate move to the cloud.\\n\\nWith more of our work and play moving online, this accelerated growth is tied to increased consumer demand for throughput and content, a global surge of smartphones, rapid development of web and mobile applications, and high costs of developer operations on-premise server management.\\n\\nThe leading centralized cloud service providers (CSP)\u2013Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud\u2013dominate with 71% market share. AWS alone is triple the size of Microsoft Azure, the second largest CSP.\\n\\nCloud computing is a concentrated and oligopolized market with pricing inefficiency and anti-competitive practices like strip-mining, where a big CSP copies the products of a smaller cloud company (already offered on its platform) and sells the products, often alongside the copied product.\\n\\nWith the market oligopolized, innovation, choice, and flexibility are stifled, and current services come at a high recurring cost with lock-in agreements.\\n\\nFor greater access, flexibility, efficiency, and security, the cloud needs to evolve to a decentralized infrastructure. New innovations, such as serverless technology, are shifting the paradigm in computing, freeing developers from set-up and server management, and enabling them to manage the resources needed to run applications.\\n\\nWithin this market context, there are 8.4 million data centers with an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized.\\n\\n#### **Akash Network\u2019s Solutions**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922422-akashsuperminiconceptrendernight1-1-1024x576.jpg)\\n\\n**Akash Supercloud**\\n\\nAs the first decentralized alternative to the cloud oligopoly, Akash Network is developing Supercloud, **the world\u2019s first and only decentralized cloud computing marketplace**, enabling any data center and anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace.\\n\\nAkash Supercloud enables organizations to access the 85% of server capacity currently underutilized at 8.4 million data centers, and on individual servers.\\n\\nThe Supercloud platform achieves these benefits by integrating advanced containerization technology with [a unique staking model](https://akash.network/blog/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/) to accelerate adoption, [built on Tendermint and Cosmos](https://akash.network/blog/decentralized-serverless-computing-coming-to-cosmos/). The Akash Token (AKT) is a utility token used in the platform to achieve economic security, incentivize early adoption, and normalize exchange rates.\\n\\n**Akash Supermini**\\n\\nAkash also develops [**Supermini**](https://akash.network/supermini/)**, a powerful portable supercomputer**. Supermini enables individuals to become cloud providers on Akash from their home or office. Supermini owners can deploy applications, run a machine learning workload, and offer Supermini\u2019s unused compute on Akash to earn income.\\n\\nMore than ever, we need a decentralized, permissionless, and open cloud where people become participants, and not just users.\\n\\nBuilt on blockchain technology, Supercloud and Supermini also provide organizations and individuals sovereignty and privacy over their data.\\n\\n#### **Competitive Advantage**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n**How Akash Differs from Cloud Service Providers**\\n\\nThrough Akash\u2019s platform, developers can easily and securely access cloud compute at 10x lower cost than the current market providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud).\\n\\n- Efficient\\n\\n  - Pay for what you need, when you need it\\n  - Sell excess capacity you are not using\\n\\n- Compatible\\n\\n  - Easy to adopt (built for mainstream)\\n  - No vendor lock-ins\\n  - Compatible with existing cloud applications\\n\\n- Price Advantage\\n\\n  - 10X less than market offerings for developers\\n  - Up to 4x more for providers of compute\\n\\n- Secure\\n\\n  - Encryption at rest, run time, transit\\n  - Web of trust model (PGP) through accreditation\\n  - Optimized for node failure\\n\\n**How Akash Differs from Decentralized Cloud Companies**\\n\\nExisting blockchain projects have high friction points for adoption without advantages such as cost. They also serve a small or unknown market size.\\n\\n- **Golem** is a supercomputer with on-chain computing. Their solution serves a small addressable market, requires users to learn a new language, and does not have cost advantages.\\n- **Dfinity** is focused on smart contracts, which have limitations.\\n- **Blockstack** is built on top of Bitcoin and is not suitable for compute.\\n\\nAkash's technology is developed to address general compute and broader market use cases. The platform is positioned to serve the mainstream market, and addresses growing needs in the machine learning market. If an application runs on existing cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, it can run on Akash.\\n\\n#### **Primary Customers**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAkash is currently focused on serving high-growth companies with data intensive workloads, and will expand to support lower growth organizations with a diverse set of workloads. The company\u2019s primary market is growth stage machine learning organizations, including artificial intelligence and deep learning companies.\\n\\nEscalating cloud costs from the major cloud service providers make running machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence workloads increasingly expensive and cost-prohibitive. Cloud costs have a compounding annual growth rate of 43.6% through 2022, and [with 25% of machine learning/AI companies\u2019 revenues spent on cloud resources](https://akash.network/blog/reducing-cloud-costs-for-machine-learning/), managing costs is critical to growth.\\n\\nDuring the global pandemic, [these workloads have become increasingly expensive and cost-prohibitive](https://akash.network/blog/battling-covid-19-with-blockchain-ai-and-cloud-computing/) for startups, academic institutions, researchers, and clinicians who need to accelerate critical research to fight COVID-19, and develop life-saving treatments.\\n\\n10x lower in cost, Akash Supercloud is a faster, more secure, and lower cost alternative to cloud service providers.\\n\\n#### **Akash Token (AKT) Economics**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922431-screen-shot-2020-07-07-at-3-01-05-pm.png)\\n\\n[Akash\u2019s economic model](https://akash.network/blog/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/) uses a native currency, Akash Token (AKT) to solve for volatility (one of the biggest challenges for adoption in crypto), while ensuring economic security of the platform\u2019s public blockchain. The model bootstraps early supply by subsidizing using inflation (i.e., borrowing from the future), and activates an incentive structure that not only fairly distributes, but will unlock network effects to accelerate growth.\\n\\nThe [Akash Token (AKT)](https://akash.network/blog/category/token-economics/) is a utility token that performs three main functions: Resolve, Reward, and Reserve.\\n\\n**Resolve**\\n\\nAkash relies on a blockchain where a set of validators vote on proposals. Each proposal is weighed by the proposer\u2019s voting power, which is the total tokens they staked and the tokens bonded to them (stakers can delegate voting power to validators).\\n\\n**Reward**\\n\\nProviders on Akash stake tokens to subsidize operating and capital expenditures. Stakers are rewarded proportional to the number of tokens staked, the length of lockup time, and the overall tokens staked in the system. Lock up times can vary anywhere from one month to one year. Flexibility in lockup encourages stakers that stake for shorter periods (bear markets), in a self-adjusting inflationary system that is designed to optimize for lower price pressure during bear markets.\\n\\n**Reserve**\\n\\nFees on Akash can be settled using a multitude of currencies, however, the market order book uses Akash Token (AKT) as the reserve currency of the ecosystem. AKT provides a novel settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and the settlement currency. This way, providers and tenants are protected from the price volatility of AKT expected to result from its low liquidity. This paper also presents a method \u201cTransaction Ordering using Consensus Weighted Median\u201d to establish exchange rates without the need for an oracle.\\n\\n#### **Founders**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAkash was founded by Greg Osuri and Adam Bozanich, globally recognized open source developers and among the top 20 programmers worldwide for authoring open-source libraries adopted by organizations including Ubuntu, HashiCorp, and Kubernetes. They lead [a team](https://akash.network/about/) of renowned open source and blockchain developers, and seasoned experts from leading technology platform companies.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922455-greg-osuri-akash-1024x768.jpg)\\n\\n**Greg Osuri, CEO**\\n\\nPrior to Akash, Greg built information technology (IT)&nbsp; infrastructure at IBM early in his career and founded AngelHack, the world\u2019s largest hackathon organization with over 150,000 developers across 50 cities worldwide.\\n\\nA renowned open source, distributed systems, and blockchain developer and applied economist, Greg\u2019s libraries regularly trend among top 5 (globally) in the Golang space, which are open sourced on GitHub. He is the author of UI Progress and Amazon RDS Cookbook -- widely used DevOps toolkits with more than 25 million downloads.\\n\\nGreg has helped launch multiple developer companies including Firebase (acquired by Google). He is a frequently featured speaker, and was instrumental in the passing of California\u2019s first Blockchain law, providing the first expert-witness testimony at the Senate.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922471-adambozanovichakash.jpg)\\n\\n**Adam Bozanich, CTO**\\n\\nPrior to Akash, Adam led software development at WeWork, Symantec, One King\u2019s Lane, and Marketron. Before that, he worked as an engineer and developer for music monetization platform Topspin, which was acquired by Apple in 2014 following an initial acquisition by Beats.\\n\\nAdam holds a U.S. patent for the invention of network protocol fuzzing, a security analysis methodology that dynamically tests a system\u2019s resilience to protocol abuse.\\n\\n#### **Investors**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nAkash partners with thought leaders and global organizations across technology and venture capital to materialize the vision of The Unstoppable Cloud.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922482-investors-1024x167.jpg)\\n\\n#### **Partners**\\n\\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThe Unstoppable Cloud movement enables the creators of the future to build with more freedom, and to give people control over their data.\\n\\nThe principle behind The Unstoppable Cloud is fully sovereign cloud infrastructure that cannot be challenged or taken down by adversaries and hackers.\\n\\nAkash partners with organizations who share a vision for an open, safe, and unstoppable cloud that unlocks capabilities for the data-driven technologies of the future.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922489-partners-copy-1024x298.jpg)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;A Primer on the First Decentralized Cloud Marketplace&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The Market Landscape for Cloud Computing&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;],[0,&quot;Product&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.N8JOnos-.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1992],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1492],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/why-akash-network-a-primer-on-the-first-decentralized-cloud-marketplace/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;partner-profile-trg-capital/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;partner-profile-trg-capital&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAs a former basketball coach, you look at people to fulfill the offense and defense you\u2019re trying to play - can the people you select on your roster execute this plan? Even though I left the basketball world four years ago, it is still a part of me: the way I see people, how teams operate, and how they can work together to achieve success.\\n\\n**\\\\- Etienne vantKruys, Founder &amp; Director of TRG Capital**\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to announce TRG Capital as a partner, joining our vision for the future of an open, sovereign, and unstoppable cloud.\\n\\nRecently, we connected with founder and director of TRG Capital, Etienne vantKruys, to dive deeper into his background and his vigilance on due diligence ( he _really_ wants to make sure you triple-check your info), and to glean his words of wisdom.\\n\\nEtienne has been passionately demystifying the world of crypto with an uncanny prowess for due diligence, uncovering the true value of companies. With his extensive experience, TRG Capital evolved and emerged into what it is today: a force of pragmatism and support, and a partner that can uncover the intricacies of what makes a team successful.\\n\\n#### **Q&amp;A with Etienne vantKruys of TRG Capital**\\n\\n**How did you start TRG Capital?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nIt was a small build up - I was a stock trader before I got into crypto, and amidst the financial crisis I started to wonder: What _really_ is money? What _really_ is the economy? What _really_ is finance?\\n\\nAs I began digging through these questions, I discovered Bitcoin, and shortly after, the whole industry of madness began kicking off in 2016 and 2017. I got a group together to form, what was then called, Token Research Group. Prior to this, I was trading stocks and was primarily a short seller looking into biotech, to give you perspective on where that hardcore investing approach came from.\\n\\nBasically, what a short seller does is that they look for the problems in your company. You want to burst that bubble and examine these startups to filter out the nonsense, the hype, and find its actual value.\\n\\nWe set out to have this product of writing research reports so that we could sell that to funds and fund managers. It\u2019s all about due diligence and we wanted to get to the bottom of what it is that\u2019s really there in these nice, flashy websites and pitch decks.\\n\\nThat\u2019s how we began, and we\u2019d start investing along, but then in 2018 the whole market changed.\\n\\nWe pivoted, and instead of just doing the research, we took our gains and transitioned to doing the investments ourselves, and that\u2019s where TRG Capital came along - that\u2019s its birth and evolution.\\n\\n**What makes TRG Capital different from other validators?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nOur emphasis on pragmatism. I meet so many entrepreneurs and developers with a strong mindset for product, but oftentimes what\u2019s lacking is an operational execution plan.\\n\\nIt\u2019s imperative to distill it down to what it is that you're building - your vision and whatever is in your white paper among all those mathematical equations - and identify the clear essence of: Who is going to use this, how do I get this to market, and what problem is this solving?\\n\\nI find that many developers and entrepreneurs somehow just breeze past these simple questions. I think to myself, \u201cThis sounds great and all, but if my mom can\u2019t use it, this isn\u2019t going to find any adoption.\u201d Reason being, you aren\u2019t building it for your developer friends. If you want adoption, it needs to be frankly, for a 5 year old. Sometimes I would look at projects and they want me to install a wallet, write 200 lines of code, and I just think, \u201cThat\u2019s cute, but you\u2019re not ready\u201d.\\n\\nProviding that mirror to these entrepreneurs and developers, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m a bit like a business coach or strategic advisor. We\u2019re not just passive checkwriters, we aim to add something extra, beyond validation. We\u2019re really down there, on the ground and dirt, as we build value and scale the company alongside you by running validator infrastructure or key industry connections.\\n\\n**How do you choose what projects to work with?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nYou filter, because once you add the word \u201cCapital\u201d to your Linkedin profile, you get bombarded with all kinds of offers and pitch decks. You have to be sure before you evangelize and put this out to 6 billion people to use it, so first and foremost, I focus on the people, secondly is product, and third is execution.\\n\\nAs a former basketball coach, you look at people to fulfill the offense and defense you\u2019re trying to play - can the people you select on your roster execute this plan? Even though I left the basketball world four years ago, it is still a part of me: the way I see people, how teams operate, and how they can work together to achieve success.\\n\\nI first met Greg last year in San Francisco during SF Launch Week in October of 2019, and got introduced by Brian of Kava. To my surprise, Boz was also there, whom I\u2019d already met in 2018 when he was still at Refereum. From there, I realized what a great team of people they were, and as Brian vouched for him, I began to do some digging into the final 2 qualities that I look for.\\n\\nLooking at Kava, and now Akash, I\u2019m seeing similar characteristics of both a strong team and product that makes me believe they can actually pull it off. We\u2019ll be rooting for that, we\u2019ll be putting our shoulders down, down in the mud, to take this forward.\\n\\n**What are current projects you\u2019re working on?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nWithout revealing my hidden gems\u2026 Kava, Jarvis, Orion, Ava Labs, StakerDAO, Ferrum, Cere, and we\u2019re looking into a couple of ecosystem startups.\\n\\n**What new developments in the ecosystem are you excited about?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nGoing back to my top criteria of great people, the addition of Jack Zampolin has really stood out. As a former coach I will tell you,\u201cYou can\u2019t win the Kentucky Derby with donkeys\u201d. If you want to win the Kentucky derby, you need quality horses, and with Jack joining, I think it will really compliment Boz, Greg, and everyone else on the team to move forward and execute the plan.\\n\\nOne thing that stuck out for me about Jack is his ability to onboard developers and amass communities of people to build and plug in. With blockchain, we\u2019re adding another trust layer on top of the internet and the way we transact value globally. You need the builders for that, and Jack is that guy that really compliments the vision that Greg set out. You need those types of people on your team who can pull them in, excite them, show them the win-win, and incentivize them to be a part of the Akash ecosystem.\\n\\nSecondly, I\u2019ve been impressed by Akash\u2019s ability to stay true and disciplined with the on-schedule launches of the product and platform.\\n\\n**What are your future plans?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nTo be a part of this global blockchain evolution. We haven\u2019t even seen 1% of its potential. I\u2019ll be here backing and supporting revolutionary developers and disruptive entrepreneurs as we chip away piece by piece at this global juggernaut monster. Part of that is being in SF for Akash\u2019s launch.\\n\\n**What advice would you give to someone interested in entering blockchain?**  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n1\\\\. Everything that\u2019s thrown at you: double check the info, triple check it even.\\n\\n2\\\\. Dare to dream, then go build it.\\n\\n3\\\\. Be more bold. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re blowing up the planet, we\u2019re just building. So it doesn\u2019t hurt to be more aggressive in what you\u2019re trying to achieve. It doesn't have to be something you start thinking about only when you pass the age of 35.\\n\\nBut to reiterate\u2026 Triple check the info! You can even put it on a stamp that reads, \u201cTriple check the info!\u201d\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Partner Profile: TRG Capital&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As a former basketball coach, you look at people to fulfill the offense and defense you\u2019re trying to play - can the people you select on your roster execute this plan?

Phase 2 will encompass three weeks of challenges.**\\n\\n**Check out our** [**Phase 2 Challenge Schedule**](https://akash.network/challenge/phase2/schedule) **and** [**Phase 2 Rewards Schedule**](https://akash.network/challenge/phase2/rewards) **to plan your strategy!**\\n\\nTo incentivize participants we\u2019ve allocated 600,000 AKT for Phase 2 rewards.\\n\\nThe Akashian Challenge Phase 2 will introduce, demonstrate, and test the decentralized exchange features of Akash. This decentralized exchange (DEX) is different from others in the cryptocurrency world, which are focused on settling trades; the Akash DEX is designed to settle requests for application deployments.\\n\\nAs this phase of the competition is primarily focused on the on-chain code, we won\u2019t be running the network in a decentralized fashion.\\n\\nWeekly challenges will focus on provider and tenant DEX operations--creating orders, bidding, handling leases--, while long-running challenges will focus on supporting a healthy network foundation.\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Long-Running Challenges**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nLong-running challenges are active for the entire Akashian Challenge. They\u2019re designed to encourage participation, and present an opportunity for us to observe longer term behaviors of the network.\\n\\nThese long-running challenges include the following, detailed below:\\n\\n- Validator Architecture and Monitoring\\n- Network Infrastructure Support\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Validator Architecture and Monitoring**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThe process of operating a validator is varied and there are [many](https://blog.polychainlabs.com/tendermint/2020/03/26/threshold-validator-for-tendermint.html) [possible](https://iqlusion.blog/a-look-inside-our-validator-architecture) [architectures](https://certus.one/sign-os) that can be used.\\n\\nThe choice of architecture depends primarily on the security model the validator operator chooses to protect against. Whatever architecture is chosen, monitoring and alerting tooling is necessary to help the validator maintain uptime and respond to on-chain events like proposals, slashing events, delegations, etc.\\n\\nTeams will earn rewards for:\\n\\n- Writing blog posts detailing their validator setup with supporting code/configuration\\n- Writing blog posts detailing their monitoring infrastructure with supporting code/configuration\\n- Making PRs that add additional prometheus metrics to the [x/deployment](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/tree/master/x/deployment), [x/market](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/tree/master/x/market) or [x/provider](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/tree/master/x/provider) modules facilitating network monitoring.\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Network Infrastructure Support**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nIn order to support the network, a validator needs to run full nodes and sentries. This long running challenge will reward validators who run seed nodes with publicly available P2P endpoints or full nodes/sentries with publicly available RPC/p2p ports.\\n\\nNote that running [tenderseed instances](https://gitlab.com/polychainlabs/tenderseed) is allowed/encouraged. Nodes must be reachable and posted in the [ovrclk/net](https://github.com/ovrclk/net) repository to be eligible for this reward.\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Weekly Challenges**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nThe Akashian Challenge: Phase 2 will encompass three weeks of challenges. Weekly challenges focus on different aspects of network functionality each week. These challenges are designed to test specific features of the DEX.\\n\\n**Week 1: Capture the Orders**\\n\\nThe Akashian Challenge team will be creating orders continuously. The Week 1 challenge asks users to explore how to operate as a provider by finding and bidding on leases. This can be accomplished by running the provider daemon, using \\\\`akashctl\\\\` and some \\\\`bash\\\\` scripting, or by building custom tooling.\\n\\n**Reward Opportunities:**\\n\\n- Validators whose providers have won the most number of leases.\\n- Validators whose providers have placed the most number of bids.\\n- Bonus Category: Blog post detailing how winning provider bids works in the Akash system, and custom code to do so.\\n\\n**Week 2: Chaos is a Ladder**\\n\\nWeek 2 is a test for throughput of the DEX. This will allow our team to identify performance bottlenecks in our code under realistic network conditions. The challenge builds on users' provider experience from the Week 1: Capture the Orders challenge and encourages them to explore how to operate as a tenant on the network.\\n\\n**Reward Opportunities:**\\n\\n- **Provider: Total Lease-Hours per Provider**: Points awarded to the provider that accumulates the greatest total number of lease-blocks. A lease block is an open lease for one block - if a provider has two leases during one block it is counted as two lease-blocks.\\n\\n- **Provider: Total Lease Count**: Points awarded to the provider that accumulates the greatest total number total leases.\\n\\n- **Tenant: Total Lease-Hours:** Points awarded to the tenant that accumulates the greatest total number of lease-blocks. A lease block is an open lease for one block - if a tenant has two leases during one block it is counted as two lease-blocks.\\n\\n- **Tenant: Total Lease Count**: Points awarded to the tenant that accumulates the greatest total number total leases.\\n\\n**Week 3: Cast a Wide Net**\\n\\nThe Week 3 challenge encompasses more throughput DEX testing, and encourages participants to explore large-scale deployment options. During this time, the provider daemon will be in Beta, in preparation for Phase 3.\\n\\n**Reward Opportunities:**\\n\\n- **Tenant: deployment with the largest number of individual providers:** Tenants can create deployments that have many orders - who can make a deployment that is fulfilled by the highest number of individual providers?\\n- **Provider: largest number of concurrent leases:** Providers may have more than one active lease at any given time. Award tokens to the provider that has the most active leases at one time over the period of the challenge.\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Phase 2 Rewards**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**\\n\\nYou can check out the [**Phase 2 Rewards Schedule**](https://akash.network/challenge/phase2/rewards) for a detailed schedule of reward opportunities.

We didn\u2019t know anything about blockchain at the time.\\n\\nWe were amazed and surprised by the potential of blockchain, and continued researching it further. We realized that we could leverage it to build a social network in a decentralized way. We didn\u2019t like the centralization authority and control by companies like Google and Facebook.\\n\\nSince 2013, we\u2019d been trying to figure out if there was a way we could change the status quo. When we learned about blockchain, we realized we could build a decentralized social network, and see if the market would adapt. That\u2019s how we formed Forbole.\\n\\nForbole in Chinese means \u201csomeone who can pick talent\u201d.\\n\\nWe started building a decentralized social network that helped people find talent--similar to LinkedIn, but through referrals. Through chance and multiple opportunities, we also became validators.\\n\\nIn late 2019, we started building and running a decentralized network called Desmos. We built an app called Mooncake that builds on Desmos.\\n\\n**What makes Forbole different from other validators?**\\n\\nOur background and experiences in digital marketing, communications, app development, and user experience make us unique. Communication is a strength, as we know how to communicate to the mass market, and as a global team, we speak multiple languages.\\n\\n**How do you choose what projects to work with?**\\n\\nWe focus on the technology and the team, and look for founders with a similar vision to ours. When we were looking at different technologies to build a decentralized social network, we started with Ethereum but realized it wasn\u2019t possible.\\n\\nIn the search for a new technology we could use, we discovered Steemit and its consensus engine. Through that, we found Tendermint, and learned about Jae Kwon. After reading his paper and learning more about him, we decided to work with Cosmos.\\n\\nWe try the technology first, before we decide to work with the team.\\n\\nWe learned about Akash through a tweet from Jack Zampolin. We researched Akash, learned more about Greg Osuri, and through participation in Akash\u2019s Founding Member Challenges (Testnet Alpha), we were able to play around with Akash\u2019s technology, and found it to be incredibly user-friendly.\\n\\nWe saw the potential for Akash\u2019s applications to open up a shared economy. This aligned with our vision, and we knew that this team shared a similar approach with our team.\\n\\n**What are current projects you\u2019re working on?**\\n\\nWe\u2019re validators and developers.\\n\\nFor validation, we work with Cosmos, IRISnet, Solana, Kava, and a few others.\\n\\nWe develop The Big Dipper, a block explorer. Anyone using Cosmos SDK can leverage the Big Dipper to easily explore the chain.\\n\\nWe also develop Desmos, a decentralized social network, and we built a DApp on top called Mooncake, a mobile app.\\n\\n**What new developments in the ecosystem are you excited about?**\\n\\nI\u2019m excited about decentralized VPN, like Sentinel. What happened last year in Hong Kong and China showed us the importance of being able to speak freely. One of the reasons we built Desmos is to enable censorship-resistance.\\n\\n**What are your future plans?**\\n\\nFor The Big Dipper, we\u2019ll be developing a separate dedicated dashboard to delegate or monitor from different networks, and we\u2019ll be working on a mobile version.\\n\\nFor Desmos, we started an incentivized testnet early this year and will release in different phases to attract validators and users. We\u2019ll bootstrap first before seeking venture capital funding.\\n\\n**What advice would you give to someone interested in entering blockchain?**\\n\\nFollow your passion and your heart. **Start at any time. We are all learning and developing something new for the next generation, so never think that you are too late.**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922423-kwun-y.jpg)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Unstoppable Cloud Partner Profile: Forbole&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;\u201cStart at any time.

Of the 100,000,000 tokens that will ever be pre-mined at genesis, we allocated 2% (2,000,000 AKTs) to the Founding Member program. The program involved three progressively difficult challenges along with bonus challenges, and contributors joined from all over the world, including the U.S., Korea, Japan, China, Europe, India, and South America.  \\n  \\nEach challenge had a corresponding reward, for a total of 3,500 Akash Tokens (AKT), with bonuses of up to 2,000 AKT. The challenges engaged contributors with Akash Supercloud, and taught them how to become compute providers and deploy applications on our open, permissionless, and secure marketplace for compute cycles, resulting in 1,802 deployments and 144 providers.&nbsp;\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922423-the-image-1024x1024.jpg)\\n\\n**Incentivized Testnet Launch**  \\n  \\n**Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the launch of our Incentivized Testnet with The Akashian Challenge next Thursday, April 30th 2020.**\\n\\n[**Register for The Akashian Challenge**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZjlvoXnezs2eoxUx4L_fUKsOyGe_He63KlUkaht6flnVqYg/viewform)\\n\\nTo incentivize participants in the Akashian Challenge, we're allocating 3% (3,000,000 AKTs!) of the 100,000,000 tokens that will ever be pre-mined at genesis.&nbsp;  \\n  \\nThe Akashian Challenge focuses on a series of tasks that get progressively more difficult, and enable participants to explore different aspects of the platform, from performing user operations to node operations.  \\n  \\nOur Testnet Beta and Akashian Challenge program is inspired by ecosystem projects from the community, such as Solana Tour de Sol, Cosmos Game of Stakes, and Kava Founder Rewards.  \\n  \\n**The Akashian Challenge**\\n\\nThe Akashian Challenge will begin on Thursday, April 30th, 2020, and run for 8 weeks in three distinct phases:\\n\\n**Phase 1: Node Operations**  \\n**Phase 2: Provider Operations**  \\n**Phase 3: Developer Operations**  \\n  \\n**Phase 1:** The participants earn tokens by solving different challenges related to operating and validating the Akash Blockchain.

Our families and communities have been impacted, and the way we live and work will never be the same. At Akash, being a distributed team has made it a little easier to transition to what is becoming \u201cthe new normal\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nWhat\u2019s happening in the world today has made our team more committed to building the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud computing marketplace, and the first viable alternative to cloud service providers (CSPs). Cloud costs from the major CSPs make running machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence workloads increasingly expensive and cost-prohibitive for startups, academic institutions, researchers, and clinicians who need to accelerate critical research to fight COVID-19, and develop life-saving treatments.\\n\\n**Q1 Progress to a Faster, Better, and Lower Cost Cloud**\\n\\nOur world won\u2019t be the same after the virus, and we\u2019ll see an even greater need for cloud compute and services, as the ways we work and play transition even more to the cloud. By leveraging the power of a free market and a permissionless, open cloud, Akash Network unlocks 85% of cloud compute capacity in 8.4 million data centers currently underutilized. 90% lower in cost, Akash is a _faster, better, more secure, and lower cost_ alternative to cloud service providers.\\n\\nDespite the global volatility of this past quarter, our team has remained focused and diligent in the progression of our mission. I wanted to share highlights of what our team has been working on this past quarter across product, partnerships, people, and promotions. I\u2019m excited to unveil our [new website](https://akash.network/) and our new Supermini portable supercomputer, as well as update on what\u2019s to come in Q2.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922423-000035340013-copy-1-1024x678.jpg)\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922446-0-1.jpg)\\n\\n**PRODUCT**\\n\\n*   **Migration to Cosmos SDK:** In Q1, we migrated to Cosmos SDK and in the process, we reduced our codebase by a massive 150,000 lines.&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Incentivized Testnet:** We made big strides in the development of our incentivized testnet--stay tuned for an announcement this week.\\n    \\n*   **Supermini Portable Supercomputer**: We\u2019ve significantly progressed design, technical specifications, and production on Supermini. We worked with design duo Guillermo Sanchez del Corral and Rafael Sanchez of debuti, and industrial designer Sungbum Park, to come up with Supermini\u2019s distinctive chassis and infinity mirror design. After much research and prototyping, we amped up the specs to a 512-core Volta GPU with 64 Tensor Cores. Production is underway for a limited launch later this year. Check out our new Supermini below.\\n    \\n*   **Decentralized Cloud Standards:** We put together a design repository for the Testnet Alpha that we released last November, in order to provide a framework for others to create and run their own testnets. With input from our community we decided to name it [Decentralized Cloud Standards](https://dcs.akash.network/spec/dcs-4).\\n    \\n*   **Akash Economics**: We evolved our Akash Network Token Economic Model. We [introduced two additional powerful drivers](https://akash.network/blog/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/) for growth and income generation in the ecosystem\u2013the allocation of subsidies, in the form of a Subsidy Pool, and the distribution of a network dividend from a portion of the lease fees, Take Income.\\n    \\n\\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\\n\\n*   **Solana**: Our goal is to provide developers with increased access to decentralized services. Last month, we announced that we were partnering with Solana to bring web-scale smart contracts to Akash Supercloud.&nbsp; Akash users will be able to run secure and scalable smart contracts on Solana\u2019s hyper-performant platform and pay using Akash Token (AKT). Solana\u2019s users will soon be able to run distributed applications (like machine learning or web apps) and settle using Solana Token (SOL) on Akash. Our partnership will also give Solana Validators the ability to run their nodes on a truly decentralized cloud and significantly decrease their cloud costs.\\n    \\n*   **The Unstoppable Cloud:** This past quarter, we expanded our ecosystem by partnering with a number of data centers, a Telco provider, and continuing to build partnerships with storage, security, and DNS providers who share our vision for an open, safe, and \u201cunstoppable\u201d cloud that unlocks capabilities for the data-driven technologies of the future. We can\u2019t wait to announce these and many more partnerships in Q2.\\n    \\n*   **Our First Stablecoin**: We\u2019ve been working on a key integration and partnership to bring a strong stablecoin into our multi-currency ecosystem that will be used for payment and settlement on our platform. We\u2019re looking forward to announcing this partnership in the coming weeks.\\n    \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922423-new-solana-blog-home-page.png)\\n\\n**PEOPLE**\\n\\n*   **Jack Zampolin:** We\u2019re fortunate to have Jack join as an advisor.

Each week, we have more colleagues, neighbors, friends, and loved ones getting infected, or felled, by a virus we still don\u2019t fully understand.\\n\\n**Leveraging Blockchain, AI, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing**\\n\\nFirst detected on December 31st, 2019, in the Chinese town of Wuhan, it wasn\u2019t too long ago on March 11th that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Throughout the month of March, COVID-19 progressively wreaked havoc around the world, with the number of global cases surpassing 750,000, and over 36,000 deaths. Italy has been the worst affected, and the U.S. has become the new epicenter of the infection with over 160,700 cases and 3,000 deaths. Infections and deaths continue to climb.\\n\\nOn March 25th, the government of India put its 1.3 billion people on the strictest and most severe lockdown yet, and in the absence of community transmission. A third of the world\u2019s population is now under lockdown, with economies around the world in various stages of paralysis or breakdown.\\n\\nThe global fight against coronavirus requires that doctors, scientists, researchers, and governments are able to track, collect, integrate, model, and analyze disparate verified data sources that can be trusted. The most promising coordinated efforts to battle the virus are those that leverage blockchain technology to securely and anonymously capture and integrate massive public and private data sets, and harness the powerful modeling and computational analysis of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning fueled by massive cloud computing resources.\\n\\n**Blockchain Enabled Capture and Tracking of Verified Data**\\n\\nWith a worldwide outbreak, real-time data needs to be quickly and securely shared across continents, countries, and teams. Given the decentralized, permissionless, and privacy characteristics of the technology, the World Health Organization (WHO) chose to build its \u201cverifiable information highway\u201d project on blockchain technology.\\n\\nTo develop the project, named MiPasa, the WHO partnered with corporations like IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft; academic institutions like John Hopkins University; and U.S., Canadian, European, and Chinese national health institutions. MiPasa leverages [IBM Blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/platform?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=000026VG&amp;utm_term=10005805&amp;utm_id=MiPasa+project+and+IBM+Blockchain+team+on+open+data+platform+to+support+Covid-19+response+In+Text&amp;cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Blockchain+and+Strategic+Alliances_Blockchain-_-WW_WW-_-MiPasa+project+and+IBM+Blockchain+team+on+open+data+platform+to+support+Covid-19+response+In+Text&amp;cm_mmca1=000026VG&amp;cm_mmca2=10005805) and is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) based platform built on Hyperledger Fabric.\\n\\nAs a global data capture, integration, and communication platform, it will aid in faster and more reliable early detection of COVID-19 carriers and virus hotspots. Utilizing advanced and powerful data analytics and privacy tools, with a dedicated user app, MiPasa\u2019s platform enables private and anonymized data sharing between individuals, state authorities, and health institutions.\\n\\nMiPasa validates data in three ways:\\n\\n- Reconciliation of disparate data sources from WHO, CDC, and others\\n- Ensuring new data entered into the system matches the original\\n- Reports from the public of inconsistencies or bad data\\n\\nBeing able to collect and analyze verified, trusted, and validated data about the virus\u2019 spread will help us better coordinate and improve efforts to contain it.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620921613-og.png)\\n\\n**Accelerating the Search for a Vaccine with AI, ML, and DL**\\n\\nWhen Chinese scientists decoded the genome sequence of the coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, and posted the results in a public database on January 10th, researchers and biotech companies raced to find a vaccine. By leveraging AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, several biotech firms already have clinical trials underway.\\n\\nIn just three hours, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company in San Diego, developed a DNA-based vaccine called INO-4800 with its SynCon machine learning system. The vaccine is progressing rapidly through preclinical, animal, and human clinical trials later this year. Another company, Moderna Therapeutics, has its mRNA-1273 vaccine ready for a clinical trial after only twenty three days.\\n\\nScientists recently set IBM\u2019s Summit, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, to work running thousands of simulations to find drug compounds that could fight the coronavirus. Housed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the supercomputer screened thousands of chemical compounds and found seven that could potentially treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, by binding to the virus\u2019 \u201cS-protein\u201d and rendering it ineffective.\\n\\n**Cloud Computing, at Scale and Distributed**\\n\\nMachine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence workloads take enormous computing power. To provide COVID-19 researchers worldwide with free access to the world\u2019s most powerful high performance computing resources and accelerate the pace of research to stop the virus, The White House announced the launch of the [COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium](https://www.ibm.com/covid19/hpc-consortium) on March 23rd, 2019, a public-private project led by The White House, the U.S. Department of Energy, and IBM, and including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and HP; academic institutions like MIT, and government agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA.\\n\\nThrough the Consortium, a number of institutions\u2019 supercomputers and advanced computing systems--in addition to horsepower from the three biggest cloud-computing services: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud--will be made available to researchers rushing to contain the virus and accelerate treatment discoveries, enabling them to process enormous amounts of calculations in hours or days, instead of weeks or months.\\n\\nFolding@Home, a distributed computing project, is leveraging a vast network of volunteered computers to aid in the battle against COVID-19. At 470 petaFLOPS, it has more computing power than the world\u2019s top seven supercomputers combined.\\n\\nLate in February as the virus started to spread, the Folding@Home project enlisted volunteers to donate their computers\u2019 unused compute to help accelerate the development of life-saving therapies, in collaboration with multiple laboratories around the world. Just in the last two weeks of March 2020, there has been a ~1,200% increase in contributors, with 400,000 new members signing up.\\n\\nLeveraging the strength of a distributed network of computing power, Folding@home\u2019s 470 petaFLOPS is helping scientists research ways to block the COVID-19 virus from attaching to human cells.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620921613-og.png)\\n\\n**Fighting Future Outbreaks**\\n\\nNow imagine a future where there is a decentralized, permissionless, and open cloud--a supercloud--made up of a network of 8.5 million data centers, and a global network of in-home supercomputers.\\n\\nParticipants in such an immense and distributed cloud could mobilize to securely and safely capture, integrate, and share vast amounts of public and anonymized private data sets asynchronously and in real-time around the world, to help track and stop future outbreaks before they progress. This same supercloud could provide much lower cost and underutilized computing to aid health organizations, governments, scientists, and clinicians to accelerate efforts to find a cure, and prevent future outbreaks.\\n\\nAt Akash, we\u2019re building this future.\\n\\nWe\u2019re developing Supercloud, the world\u2019s first decentralized cloud computing marketplace, to unlock the unused compute of those 8.5 million data centers and a network of in-home Superminis. We\u2019re currently underway on production of the Supermini, a powerful portable server and supercomputer. Built on blockchain technology, Supercloud and Supermini also provide organizations and individuals sovereignty and privacy over their data.\\n\\nEscalating cloud costs from the major cloud service providers make running machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence workloads increasingly expensive and cost-prohibitive for startups, academic institutions, researchers, and clinicians. Up to 90% lower in cost, Akash Supercloud is a faster, better, more secure, and lower cost alternative to cloud service providers.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be sharing more about our Supercloud and Supermini in the coming weeks. For now, here\u2019s a teaser for our Supermini.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620921613-og.png)\\n\\n[**Learn More About Supercloud**](https://akash.network/)\\n\\n**Join Our** [**Telegram**](https://t.me/AkashNW) **for Updates**\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Battling COVID-19 with Blockchain, AI, and Cloud Computing&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;We\u2019re just beginning to experience the \u201cnew normal\u201d of lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing, of a complete disruption to our way of living and our way of working.

But we know for certain that technology startups like ours, especially those at early and growth stage, need to be more focused and vigilant than ever, as we don\u2019t have billions in cash of runway and a safety net.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922425-reducing-1.png)\\n\\nThere are many examples of companies being forged in times of chaos (dot com crash, \u201809 recession, etc), and this time is no different.&nbsp; Resilience matters because it demonstrates your team\u2019s adaptability to changing environments, and today, if you\u2019re a big data company (ML, AI, DL), you\u2019re confronted with a multitude of challenges.\\n\\n**Challenges with Cost Reduction in Machine Learning**  \\n  \\nFirst, focus on what's valuable for your customers right now as their priorities have most likely shifted in an economic downturn.&nbsp; Your company's value proposition, at a high level, does two things:\\n\\n1.  Helps increase revenue\\n    \\n2.  Helps reduce costs\\n    \\n\\nGenerally, increasing revenue holds more weight, but during economic uncertainty and a looming recession, reducing costs becomes critical.&nbsp; With traditional companies, there are ways to minimize COGS (inexpensive raw materials, better rates with suppliers, etc.), but for machine learning companies that rely on cloud computing, options are few and inflexible.&nbsp; Costs can increase exponentially due to an increase in volume, a code configuration change, or vendor lock in.&nbsp; Simply migrating to different Cloud Service Providers isn\u2019t simple or inexpensive_._  \\n  \\nWith 25% of ML/AI\u2019s revenue spent on cloud resources, reducing costs will benefit your margins, and ML/AI margins aren\u2019t as attractive to VCs if you\u2019re fundraising.&nbsp; Relative to SaaS companies with 70%-80% margin benchmarks, ML/AI are mirroring that of service companies at 50-60% margins ([A16Z on new business of AI](https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/)).&nbsp; Additionally, SaaS solutions can be sold as subscriptions for recurring revenue, ensuring longer client retention.  \\n  \\nFor machine learning companies, there are many aspects that hinder margins, like model inference, training, and rich media. With high cloud operations costs and more demanding software, cloud bills are acute pain points for ML companies with limited options.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922443-reducing-2.png)\\n\\nCloud costs have a compounding annual growth rate of 43.6% through 2022, eroding&nbsp; healthy growth and margins for growth stage ML companies with a minimum annual cloud compute spend in the six-figures. There have been few alternatives to the CSP oligopoly.  \\n  \\nWithin this market context, there are 8.4 million data centers with an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized.&nbsp;  \\n  \\nTo provide an alternative to the cloud oligopoly and to leverage this underutilized capacity from data centers, Akash is developing the Supercloud, the world\u2019s first and only decentralized peer-to-peer cloud marketplace for serverless compute and services, enabling any data center and anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace.  \\n  \\n**How Akash Can Help**  \\n  \\nOn Akash\u2019s platform, developers (tenants) _set_ their own prices and allow cloud providers to _bid_ for the workload in a reverse auction.&nbsp; Coupled with our economics, we\u2019re able to save up to 10x on your cloud compute bill, and help cloud providers earn up to 4X more than AWS ([_Akash Token Economics_](https://akash.network/blog/2020/02/05/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/) _and_ [_Research_](https://akash.network/static/akash-econ.pdf)_)_.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \\n  \\nML/AI companies (or anyone with a computer) can become a node in our network to sell their excess compute, providing an additional income source and greater flexibility to ramp up or down based on your needs with:\\n\\n*   no vendor lock-in agreements\\n    \\n*   exponential savings\\n    \\n*   increased efficiency and productivity&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n    \\n\\nFor developers, we\u2019ll soon be announcing more about Akash\u2019s Supermini, a plug-and-earn portable server and supercomputer for the home packed with 512 CUDA cores with 4x NVIDIA maxwell GPUs.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922460-akashsuperminiconceptrenderday1-1024x576.jpg)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Reducing Cloud Costs for Machine Learning&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The full global economic impact of the coronavirus is hard to put into words or fancy graphs.

Tokens serve as incentives that are usually sold by a company through a public sale (Initial Exchange Offering), or as a reward for user behavior that benefits the issuing platform.\\n\\nSpecific rights awarded to a token holder include\\\\[efn_note\\\\]&nbsp;S+C Intelligence, Token Rights: Key Considerations in Cryptoeconomic Design.\\\\[/efn_note\\\\]:\\n\\n- **Profit or fees:** A token can entitle its holders to a portion of fees or profits from using the network. It\u2019s similar to a company stock, though generally such tokens do not assign voting rights.\\n- **Access rights:** Tokens can be used to determine access to a network and to pay transaction fees. Usually they are not the sole means of payment and other currencies can be used, but small amounts of the specific token are required to use the platform at a minimum.\\n- **Governance rights:** This type of token entitles its holders to influencing the direction of the platform/protocol, including feature selection, vendor selection, etc. It is a basic feature of distributed autonomous organizations.\\n- **Block creation rights:** This type of token is most commonly found in a proof-of-stake system. Token holders can become block validators, and their&nbsp; chances to become the validator roughly equal to their proportion of tokens staked.\\n\\n**The Primary Types of Tokens**\\n\\nAt a higher level, tokens are generally categorized along the following types. Based on their categorization and the financial interest involved, they are treated differently by regulatory bodies.\\n\\n**Payment tokens** are synonymous with cryptocurrencies. They don\u2019t have further functions or links to other development projects. Tokens may in some cases only develop the necessary functionality and become accepted as a means of payment over a period of time. Examples for payment tokens include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (Ether).\\n\\n**Utility tokens** are intended to provide digital access to an application or service. They help in building an internal economy within the system, e.g., by rewarding its users to verify transactions within the blockchain. Utility tokens can give the holders the opportunity to vote on the network\u2019s overall stability and security.\\n\\nUtility tokens do not fall under securities treatment from a financial and tax perspective. However, with limited token supply and relevant utility of the token, its price can increase significantly due to supply-demand discrepancies. Examples for utility tokens include Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Akash Token (AKT). At Akash, AKT is core to [our token economic model](https://akash.network/static/akash-econ.pdf), and leveraged to secure and scale our distributed cloud computing marketplace.\\n\\n**Security, or asset tokens** award a token holder the right to implement investment interests, e.g., by participating in a legal entity\u2019s earnings streams or via receiving dividends or interest payments. To determine whether a token falls into this category, the Howey test is applied: If a transaction is an investment of money in a common enterprise and there is an expectation of profit from the work of the promoters or third party, then the underlying token is a security token\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\].\\n\\nIn terms of their economic function, the tokens are analogous to equities, bonds or derivatives. Like traditional financial instruments, they are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://www.sec.gov/ICO.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\]. Examples for security tokens include Blockchain Capital (BCAP) and Science Blockchain (SCI).\\n\\n**How Tokens are Used in Blockchain**\\n\\nIssuing tokens enables a platform to raise the funds necessary to implement projects, and it can also engage individuals with the projects over time. Tokens may be used to validate transactions and create new blocks on a blockchain.\\n\\nFor example, platforms that leverage a proof of stake consensus mechanism require the staking of tokens to verify transactions. In return for commiting tokens to staking, individuals receive staking rewards and potentially a share of transaction fees from the platform\u2019s offering\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/11/brave-new-world-of-staking-a-primer-on-proof-of-stake-pos/.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\].\\n\\n**The Rise of Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) and Security Token Offerings (STO)**\\n\\nThe landscape of token offerings has changed significantly in the past few years. During 2017 and 2018, a large number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) took place. Companies were able to raise $5+ billion in 2017 and $20+ billion in 2018 through ICOs. ICOs have significantly declined in frequency and valuation, due to concerns about lacking due diligence, investor protection via regulation,&nbsp; and even fraudulent activities\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://fortune.com/2018/05/12/ico-blockchain/.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\]. As a result, the number of ICOs declined over 70% in 2019, and the amount raised dropped by over 90% compared to 2019.\\n\\nAt the same time, Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) and Security Token Offerings (STO) have significantly increased in popularity.\\n\\nIn IEOs, tokens with a specified use case such as accessing the blockchain\u2019s solution or verifying its transactions, are offered through an exchange, rather than directly to investors. This ensures that the exchange performs due diligence before listing the token, thus ensuring that dodgy tokens are weeded out. After the IEO, tokens should be immediately tradeable\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/21/initial-exchange-offering-ieo-ico/.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\].\\n\\nIn STOs, the use case for a token doesn\u2019t have to be specified in detail, all tokens are backed up by specific assets. Tokens additionally offer legal rights such as voting and revenue distribution, and are subject to regulation. In essence, security tokens are investment contracts that represent legal ownership of a physical or digital asset, and the blockchain is used to verify ownership.\\n\\nThe key difference between IEOs and STOs is that IEOs are for projects that launch utility tokens, which allow the token holder to leverage the network they are issued on and to participate in voting. STOs on the other hand are very similar to traditional investment contracts. In short, STOs have to pass the Howey test, while IEOs have to fail it.\\n\\nBoth IEOs and STOs have shown strong growth in recent years. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume, pioneered token sales via IEOs, with highly successful initial token sales starting in late 2018. In the first half of 2019 alone, IEOs increased by 6000% to over 120, via 15+ launchpads. The first STO took place with Blockchain Capital in 2017. Since then, the annual count of STOs jumped from 5 in 2017 to 35 and 55 in 2018 and 2019, respectively\\\\[efn_note\\\\]https://blockstate.com/global-sto-study-en/.\\\\[/efn\\\\_note\\\\].\\n\\nThe wide ranging impact of ICO busts in 2017/2018 brought valuable learnings to token offerings, reflected in IEOs\u2019 and STOs\u2019 improved transparency, security and liquidity. With the accelerating adoption of proof of stake consensus, more organizations are adopting novel ways to leverage token economics to build and scale their networks.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Rise of Tokens in Blockchain&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;What is a Token?&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Maly Ly&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.BgP_RDN8.jpg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1024],&quot;height&quot;:[0,683],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/the-rise-of-tokens-in-blockchain/banner-image.jpg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud-computing/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud-computing&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;Today\u2019s market for cloud computing is heavily consolidated, with the top 4 cloud service providers, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud dominating 70% of the entire market as of the end of 2019 .\\n\\nIn this oligopolistic market structure, there is decreasing competition and over time, less choice and flexibility for organizations needing cloud computing[1](https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/26/how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-631). Early on, these organizations get locked into the technology frameworks and contracts of the CSPs as they scale and as their cloud infrastructure and computing needs grow.\\n\\nWith over 80% of enterprise workloads projected to be in the cloud in 2020, there is increased risk of market power abuse and distortions, with broad ripple effects across a range of industries[2](https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/26/how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-631).&nbsp;\\n\\n**Massive supply-side inefficiencies**\\n\\nOn the cloud capacity supply side, a massive inefficiency is noteworthy: on average, data centers worldwide are running at only 70% utilization of their total capacity. Companies that have data centers, in particular ones that are not participating in the cloud market as suppliers, on average overspend 30% on their total cost of ownership of the required cloud capacity[3](https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/26/how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-631). This allocation inefficiency provides a huge opportunity to increase utilization, amortize cost, and reduce cloud compute pricing.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning accelerates cloud compute demand**\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are driving the accelerating growth for computing capacity. The economic impact of AI and ML companies across all industries cannot be overstated. They are projected to create an additional 15% of global GDP by 2030. Growth of the AI and ML market is massive, with annual revenues expected to surpass $200 billion in the next 5 years, from $20 billion just a couple of years ago. The US alone now has over 2,100 AI companies, China 1,000+, with the UK, Canada, and India following at 400, 300, and 150 respectively[4](https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/26/how-blockchain-is-transforming-cloud/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-631).&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nThe infrastructure requirements driven by this growth are significant: the amount of data processed through artificial intelligence algorithms will reach 1.4 zettabytes (1 zettabyte is 1 trillion gigabytes) by 2025.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Key benefits of cloud computing for AI and ML companies**\\n\\nThe cloud brings a number of benefits to AI and ML companies, especially for earlier stage startups:\\n\\n*   **Startup cost and scale:**&nbsp;The standard pay per use model eliminates costly startup investments and allows for accommodating spikes in workloads based on data volume. While the lowered startup cost is beneficial to just about any early stage company, the ability to accommodate peak workloads flexibly is particularly valuable to ML companies, for example, when training data models.\\n    \\n*   **Easy access:**&nbsp;The cloud allows easy access for companies of all sizes to experiment with ML, and accommodate scaling of capacity when projects go into production, and demand for the new service increases.&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Ease of use:**&nbsp;Through the cloud, companies can get access to advanced ML options and tools without requiring large-scale advanced AI and data science expertise. This enables companies to experiment with AI tools with small teams to validate the benefits before committing to a substantial ramp up of an AI/ML organization.&nbsp;\\n    \\n\\nThe main benefits from cloud computing for companies evolve with a company\u2019s experience in AI/ML, the volume and size of AI/ML projects, and the internal technical expertise a company assembles to solve AI/ML problems.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why blockchain will transform cloud computing**\\n\\nThe benefits of cloud computing to companies throughout their lifecycle can be enhanced significantly through blockchain technology. In fact, the main virtues of blockchain make it possible to address unfavorable market dynamics, reduce supply-side inefficiencies, and enhance the usability, scalability, and total cost for companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\n**Market efficiency:**&nbsp;Through blockchain technology, the marketplace for cloud compute capacity opens up for companies and individuals that have surplus data capacity. Blockchain allows them to become suppliers of cloud capacity, and companies/users in need of cloud capacity can flexibly purchase the surplus capacity at a fraction of the prices offered by the major cloud service providers. The outcome is highly efficient utilization of data center capacity, as well as a significantly lower market price for every gigabyte of cloud computing capacity.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Security and transparency:**&nbsp;Blockchain\u2019s underlying protocol and consensus mechanism ensures a maximum level of security for every transaction and underlying data, as well as establishing transparency and accountability for every participant. Through a distributed ledger, a permanent audit trail is created that protects the anonymity of every participant, while maintaining a record of every transaction.&nbsp;\\n\\n**Decentralization benefits:**&nbsp; The decentralized secured nature of blockchain enhances the overall security of cloud computing. Activating unused data center capacity around the world enables cloud capacity to be leveraged closest to the user and their technologies and devices, reducing latency and faster disaster recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\n**What\u2019s next**\\n\\nCloud computing has hit a new peak in 2020 due in large part to the accelerating growth of AI and ML technologies that require massive computing capacity. Blockchain provides a powerful solution to addressing current inefficiencies that impact pricing, innovation, and cost structure for users and suppliers. At Akash Network, we\u2019ve leveraged blockchain to build the world\u2019s first decentralized peer-to-peer cloud marketplace for serverless computing, enabling any data center and anyone with a computer to easily sell their unused compute.\\n\\nWith the advent of blockchain-powered cloud offerings, there will be more secure, more flexible, and significantly lower cost alternatives to the top 4 CSPs. More efficiently utilized data centers will achieve better utilization and amortization of their capital expenditures, and in-home innovations like the Helium Hot Spot and the&nbsp;[Akash Supermini server](https://akash.network/supermini/reserve)&nbsp;will enable individual users to participate in the marketplace.&nbsp;\\n\\n1.

This is because the SEC has tried to apply Howey analysis to crypto projects that effectively classify any token that requires management as a Security.\\n\\nSince the token value of an early stage crypto project depends on the efforts of the team to achieve decentralization, the tokens for such projects are classified as securities under the Howey lense.\\n\\nSecurities have limitations for distribution. One such limitation is purchasability. For example, the tokens can only be purchased by accredited investors, meaning purchasers need to have at least $1 million in liquid assets. This limits users from purchasing tokens to use them.\\n\\nThis created a regulatory catch-22. Projects need to distribute tokens to achieve decentralization but cannot do so in a compliant manner.\\n\\nRecently, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce proposed a&nbsp;[framework](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-blockress-2020-02-06)&nbsp;that allows promising decentralized projects to distribute (sale/drop) tokens in the US and avoid being regulated as securities as long as they satisfy a set of five conditions.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not a legal professional and this is not legal advice; this is merely my analysis and opinion.\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Meaningful Decentralization in Three Years\\n\\nThe initial project must enable the network to achieve meaningful decentralization in three years, upon which the token will no longer be considered a security. To assess decentralization, the network should not be controlled by a single individual or a group of individuals, or entities under common control\u2013this goes beyond just preventing 51% attacks.\\n\\nAnother assessment would be if the token is actually used to exchange value pertaining to the network by the end of three years. For example, a token used to trade compute cycles or storage is moving value in the network.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Disclose Key Information\\n\\nSince three years is a long period, the team should disclose key information to address asymmetry concerns and should be on a freely accessible public website. A minimum set of disclosure falls into three key categories: protocol design, token metrics and economics, and operational transparency.\\n\\n### 2.1 Network\\n\\n- Any key information that affects the token value should be disclosed.\\n- The source code and all the transaction history must be made public.\\n- The token buyers need to clearly understand the purpose and the mechanics of the network.\\n- The team should encourage the development of block explorers, dashboards, and wallets.\\n- The team must explain the launch and supply process for the token.\\n- There has to be a governance mechanism for making changes to the protocol.\\n\\n### 2.2 Token Mechanics\\n\\nThe Team must disclose the below information pertaining to the token:\\n\\n- The number of tokens to be issued in the initial allocation\\n- The total number of tokens to be created\\n- The release schedule for the tokens\\n- The total number of tokens outstanding\\n- The token mining (generation) protocol\\n- Token burning protocol\\n- The process for validating transactions\\n- The consensus mechanism\\n\\n### 2.3 Operational Transparency\\n\\n- The team must publish a roadmap with the development plan, the current state, and the timeline for development and how and when the team plans to achieve network maturity.\\n- The team must explain how they\u2019ll finance the roadmap.\\n- The team must disclose the team member profiles with names, relevant experience, qualifications, and skills.\\n- The team must disclose the number of tokens owned by each member of the team with the transferability (lockup) limitations.\\n- The team must disclose any time a member sells 5% or of their originally held tokens over any period of time.\\n- The team must periodically publish development updates or updates to token economics or network protocol.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. The Token Must Have Utility\\n\\nThe token should be sold for facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network. Meaning the safe harbor does not apply for debt or digitized securities (STO for eg).\\n\\n## 4.&nbsp; Ensure Token Liquidity\\n\\nThe project team should ensure sufficient liquidity for the token. If the team chooses to secure secondary trading of the token on a trading platform (OTC for eg), the platform should comply with state and federal laws relating to money transmission, anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection. SEC recognizes secondary trading is necessary to get tokens into the hands of people that will use them, and to offer developers and people who provide services on the network a way to exchange their tokens for fiat or cryptocurrency. The team should also disclose to the public any secondary trading platforms on which the token trades.\\n\\n## 5\\\\. The Team Would Have to File a Notice of Reliance.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe final condition is that a team member must file a notice of reliance on EDGAR within fifteen days of the date of the first token sale in reliance on the safe harbor.&nbsp; As part of the filing, a member of the team would have to attest that all the conditions of the safe harbor are satisfied.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI believe this proposal is a great first step towards creating a healthy regulatory climate for decentralizing innovation in the US and around the world.

Superiority in their energy efficiency, lower barriers to entry, and governance aspects like a lower tendency for centralization make PoS an increasingly popular alternative to Proof of Work (PoW), which is leveraged to reach consensus in current iterations of Bitcoin and [Ethereum](https://www.brokerchoices.com/ethereum-ira/), for example.\\n\\nStaking market capitalization is approaching $18 billion, an 18-month high, with the total value locked in staking at an all-time high of over $11 billion. About 50% of the highest-valued cryptocurrencies by market cap are utilizing a PoS&nbsp;[mechanism](https://www.stakingrewards.com/journal/research/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake-Research-report/). Several major projects are in progress to transition into PoS, for example, Ethereum. These developments are driven by a number of advantages that PoS brings compared to the historically more dominant Proof of Work algorithms.\\n\\n**Reaching Consensus, from Work to Stake**\\n\\nIn blockchain, a consensus mechanism ensures that every transaction on the blockchain is verified and all participants in the blockchain agree on the status of the ledger. There are various consensus mechanisms in use today. Among the most predominant ones are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).\\n\\nPoW requires the solving of a complex, computation-heavy problem before new transactions can be added to the blockchain. Participants with the highest computing power have the highest probability of solving the problem and thus securing the next block.\\n\\nPoW is very energy-intensive to operate, and resource consumption only intensifies as networks scale in adoption and number of transactions. Bitcoin alone is exceeding the annual energy use of a number of sizable nation states. Additionally, PoW blockchains tend to centralize, mainly driven by economies of scale in the establishment of computing power needed for mining.\\n\\nThe heavy resource and energy requirements and disadvantages of PoW have increased the popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus.\\n\\n**The Benefits of Proof of Stake**\\n\\nPoS assigns validation of the next block of transactions on the blockchain to a participant based on the number of tokens held. Instead of focusing on computing power, participants are incentivized to maximize their staked token holdings in the blockchain\u2019s currency. Fairness is ensured through coin-age based selection or randomization processes.\\n\\nFollowing are key differences between PoS and PoW:\\n\\n- **Energy efficiency:**&nbsp;With Proof of Stake, there isn\u2019t a collective rat race to solve a complex, heavy-compute problem. As a result, PoS is significantly more energy efficient as a consensus mechanism than PoW.\\n- **Decentralization:**&nbsp;PoW fosters concentrated investments in computing power. Joining a mining pool unlocks exponential rewards for individual miners, as the concentrated mining capacity enables a disproportionately higher probability of mining the next block. In PoS, rewards are linear to the proportion of staked coins. This may lead to some centralization, but with much lower incentives than PoW.\\n- **Security:**&nbsp;In PoS networks, a bad actor would have to own 51% or more of the staked tokens to manipulate the network. This implies that the initiator of a network manipulation would also be the most negatively impacted by the damage. Further, controls like slashing of the invested stake of a bad actor removes all incentives for such behaviors.\\n- **Currency stability:**&nbsp;In PoS networks, new transactions are validated by the participants most invested in the staking currency. As a result, holding and staking the network\u2019s currency is incentivized. This contrasts to PoW networks, where heavy investments in compute power and energy are required. These investments require fiat currency, and miners have to withdraw network tokens for conversion, causing downward pressure on token valuation.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922314-hal-gatewood-ogvqxgl7xo4-unsplash.jpg)\\n\\n**A New World of Reaching Consensus**\\n\\nA number of compelling blockchain projects are leveraging PoS mechanisms to secure their networks, prevent centralization, and increase speed of consensus:\\n\\n[**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/)&nbsp;has been working on a transition from PoW to PoS for several years, with a first public draft spec of their Casper consensus protocol published in 2017. The main drivers for this transition are the centralization tendency and heavy energy consumption of PoW. Ethereum\u2019s Casper protocol will integrate a slashing mechanism to better secure the chain.\\n\\n[**EOS**](https://eos.io/)&nbsp;is running a delegated PoS algorithm to manage the consensus process. Delegates are selected through a continuous approval system to lead consensus. By reducing the number of validating parties through delegation, new blocks of transactions can be verified in shorter time intervals.\\n\\n[**Tezos**](https://tezos.com/)&nbsp;uses a liquid PoS algorithm that leverages both direct and delegated voting to achieve consensus. Participants with staked currency can vote directly or delegate their voting responsibilities. Through delegation, this model becomes highly scalable, as any participant who isn\u2019t able to submit a vote can simply delegate their vote.\\n\\nIn the&nbsp;[**Cosmos Network**](https://cosmos.network/)**,**&nbsp;where the Tendermint engine handles networking and consensus for each blockchain, the application layer defines the validator set. A public blockchain on Cosmos leverages a PoS mechanism if its validators are elected based on the number of coins they hold (as opposed to a private blockchain where validators are appointed by the application).\\n\\nAs part of the Cosmos ecosystem,&nbsp;[**Akash Network**](https://blog.akash.network/2020/02/05/an-evolution-of-akash-network-token-economics/)&nbsp;also leverages PoS in the form of a native currency to solve for volatility (one of the biggest challenges for adoption in crypto) while ensuring economic security of our public blockchain. The core utility of our Akash Token (AKT) acts as a staking mechanism to secure the network and normalize cloud compute prices for Akash\u2019s marketplace auction.\\n\\nThe amount of AKTs staked towards a validator defines the frequency by which the validator may propose a new block and its weight in votes to commit a block. In return for bonding (staking) to a validator, an AKT holder becomes eligible for block rewards (paid in AKT) as well as a proportion of transaction fees and service fees (paid in any of the whitelisted tokens).\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922324-pietro-jeng-n6b49ltx7nm-unsplash.jpg)\\n\\n**Opening Access for Staking Incentives**\\n\\nIn addition to stabilizing blockchains, participants in PoS blockchains can make money by staking coins. In exchange for locking up tokens, the token holders receive incentives based on the amount they stake and other parameters. At Akash, we also distribute incentives based on the length of time Akash Tokens (AKT) are locked up.\\n\\nToken holders can stake the project\u2019s tokens via a wallet, staking pool, or exchange. As new blocks are created, stakers receive staking rewards. Rewards vary for different tokens. Across 70+ tokens, Staking Rewards is tracking an average return of 13.4%.\\n\\nMore and more instruments are created to support staking, ranging from specialized wallets to staking pools. These tools focus on addressing the main barriers to entry for new participants, in particular security and ease of use.\\n\\nIn a standard PoS mechanism, stakeholders need to always be online to be eligible to produce a new block. This drives heavy power consumption and increases the risk of hacker attacks.\\n\\nThrough staking pools, token holders don\u2019t have to be online continuously. The pools need to ensure that the foundation is well controlled and block production is secured. The disadvantages to staking pools are higher risk for hacking and the lack of guidance on taxation.\\n\\n**What\u2019s Next for Proof of Stake**\\n\\nThe advantages of Proof of Stake over Proof of Work mechanisms, in particular energy efficiency, scalability, and lower tendency to centralization, have led to a rapid rise of PoS networks.\\n\\nAny residual concerns about the security of PoS blockchains, as they have not been exposed to the historically high transaction volumes of PoW, are getting addressed with continuous refinements and development in the ecosystem.\\n\\nStaking PoS blockchains and reaping investment benefits is becoming easier and more secure through wallets, staking pools, and exchanges, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for new participants. To support a rising number of applications and a steady increase in transaction volume, the proliferation of PoS is a critical step towards sustainability, scalability, and continued decentralization of the blockchain.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922332-laimannung-bnz895q8ne-unsplash-1.jpg)\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Brave New World of Staking: A Primer on Proof of Stake (PoS)&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms are steadily expanding in their use across a variety of blockchain applications.

In the paper, we presented various strategies to mitigate inherent adoption challenges that face an early market economy \u2014 lack of sufficient demand from the tenants (consumers of computing), which in turn hurts demand because of lack of supply.\\n\\nWe shared a framework that can be applied to any marketplace to bootstrap early supply by subsidizing using inflation (i.e., borrowing from the future). We created a model to activate an incentive structure that not only fairly distributes but will unlock network effects to accelerate growth. With AKT, we create subsidies by borrowing from the future to create the effects of liquidity at an agreeable price point. These subsidies nurture continued network growth and lead to more liquidity, which further accelerates growth.\\n\\nIn this article, we present the market context for Akash\u2019s compelling alternative to the cloud infrastructure oligopoly, and an evolution of our Akash Network Token Economic Model. We introduce two additional powerful drivers for growth and income generation in the ecosystem\u2013the allocation of subsidies, in the form of a Subsidy Pool, and the distribution of a network dividend from a portion of the lease fees, Take Income.\\n\\n**The Cloud Infrastructure Oligopoly**\\n\\nOligopolies can result in various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.\\n\\nOligopolies happen when a product or service is commoditized. With the advent of containerization, catalyzed by technologies like kubernetes, cloud computing has effectively evolved into a commodity.\\n\\nFueled by accelerated global demand for cloud computing, cloud infrastructure is projected to reach $210 billion by 2022 with four companies controlling 71% of the market\u2013Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\nCloud computing is a concentrated market with pricing inefficiency, built on the premise that you can only source cloud capacity through a central cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nTo be competitive, technology platforms have needed to either enhance existing capabilities, introduce a novel solution to a problem, or engage in&nbsp;[anti-competitive practices](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html).\\n\\n**Breaking the Oligopoly by Decentralization**\\n\\nWithin this market context, there are 8.4 million data centers with an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized.\\n\\nTo provide an alternative to the cloud oligopoly and to leverage this underutilized capacity from data centers, Akash is creating the Supercloud, the world\u2019s first and only decentralized peer-to-peer cloud marketplace for serverless compute and services, enabling any data center and anyone with a computer to&nbsp;[become a cloud provider](https://akash.network/docs/providers/kube)&nbsp;by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace.\\n\\nFor a system to reach or exceed the scale of the internet, the system should improve on the foundational principles of the internet while solving for inefficiencies inadvertently introduced. We designed Akash to be a decentralized and open ecosystem that is censorship-resistant and self-sovereign.\\n\\nAkash\u2019s marketplace employs a novel reverse auction mechanism where the tenant (the buyer of computing) sets the price they\u2019re willing to pay and providers bid for the order where the compute provider that bids the lowest wins the job. This ensures that computing is offered at a price point set by a free market, determined by the forces of demand and supply.\\n\\n**Reducing The Barrier to Entry and Accelerating Growth**\\n\\nWhile there clearly is an abundant supply of computing and the Akash Platform is priming up to unlock this supply, the early stages of a market economy need to solve the demand-supply paradox of short-term undersupply, to reach market equilibrium and unlock network effects.\\n\\nTo solve the demand-supply paradox, we can use the subsidies from inflation (i.e., borrowing from the future) as described in our framework \u201c[Bootstrapping the Free Market By Borrowing From Future\u201d.](https://akash.network/blog/bootstrapping-a-free-market-by-borrowing-from-the-future/)\\n\\nAkash employs an inflation model where a portion of block rewards are captured by a subsidy pool that is distributed to achieve adoption goals depending on the stage of the network, and involves stakeholders performing challenges to claim the subsidy. These subsidy distributions and claim challenges are governed by means of community proposals that are expected to evolve as the network grows. The Subsidy Pool Rate is a governed network parameter that\u2019s subject to change based on community consensus. The proposed Subsidy Pool Rate at genesis is 50%.\\n\\n**Exponential Cost Savings by Subsidizing Supply**\\n\\nIn the first phase of Akash, we propose using \u201cexponential cost savings\u201d as the initial subsidy trigger. An exponential cost reduction (10x-15x the market) is an extremely attractive incentive for cloud users where cost remains a top industry priority for three years in a row \u2014 particularly to price-sensitive segments such as machine learning and big data.\\n\\nIn this model, the subsidies are distributed periodically based on the Subsidy Distribution Cycle network parameter, which is expected to be daily (or equivalent block periods) at genesis.\\n\\nAs a first step, a tenant asks for a low price and providers that win the bid by offering the lowest price are awarded a bounty. The bounty in the early days may be exponentially high (usually 5x \u2013 6x the cost).\\n\\nFor example, Alice wants to run a machine learning application and it costs her $10 / day today on the cloud. Alice then realizes that she gets 10 times more resources on Akash for the same price and she places a bid for $1 / day on Akash\u2019s marketplace.\\n\\nBob and Charlie are cloud providers on Akash. Bob expects to earn $5 / day for running Alice\u2019s Job and Charlie (with a better fill rate) expects to earn $6 / day.&nbsp; A fill rate is the percent of bids won.\\n\\nLet\u2019s assume the subsidy pool is at $20 / day. This Order is placed on the order book for $1 / day which receives no bids. From there on, the Ask increments every block period by using the subsidy until a provider fulfills the order&nbsp;*or*&nbsp;the subsidy pool is exhausted for that distribution cycle. Any unspent subsidy is carried on to the next cycle.\\n\\nIn our example, let\u2019s say after 4 blocks, the Ask reaches $5. Bob bids for $5 and Charlie bids for $6. Bob wins the Job and earns $5 whereas Alice pays $1. The $4 is paid to Bob from the subsidy pool and $16 is carried to the next cycle.\\n\\nAlice then posts another order for $1. With the subsidy pool at $20 / day, the pool accumulates to $36. Bob is fully utilized and cannot offer any more compute. Charlie realizes he\u2019s the only one that can fulfill the order and waits until the Ask reaches $36. Charlie now bids on the order and earns $36, 6x what he expected to earn.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922312-kawvcvsdg1vdrjavryqdd4xngc7tkhmiqqosq5wge6x9isxirvjhyp65t7molvrdh1pg93-zpmqotocxlixiaa9vuwyii0atjlvn7qwtokuty65weuia4kemgak1zeewvyqx.png)\\n\\nAlice happily posts another order for $1. Since the subsidy pool in the previous bid was won by Charlie, the subsidy pool resets to $20. Bob realizes Charlie made $36 and adds more capacity to the network, expecting to take part in the network prosperity. Bob realizes that he\u2019s the only provider and decides to wait until the Ask reaches $20.\\n\\nBut Alice is so pleased that she can\u2019t help but share her Akash experience with her friends. Now the Ask is at $15. Danny, another provider, hears about this and decides to offer his capacity to Akash and expects to earn $5. He sees an offer for $15 and bids for $15. Danny earns $15. Alice Pays $1.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922320-s6uk4j1nirumr2fcbrmc6grbsfro3ob0c9jtfzv9b1rwtxwbaeycmoacxicrqy4bjwiuunlh95ddrjv5qmbbeknbunho1e1xxbkispg3nscffkactjvwozsmenrrqfa4kh1b.png)\\n\\nAkash\u2019s system design ensures that a provider can be at risk of losing a job (and subsidy along with it) if they\u2019re always trying to win the entire subsidy, and encourages providers to employ incremental strategies.\\n\\n**Attracting Liquidity using Network Dividend**\\n\\nIn addition to a portion of the block rewards, Akash Token (AKT) holders receive a portion of the lease fee by means of a Take Income. A portion of the income from every lease is captured by a Take Pool which is then distributed to AKT holders based on their Stake Weight (tokens locked and unlock time). The Take Rate is a network parameter established by the consensus of the community and expected to be 20% at genesis. The proposed Take Rate of 20% is common with high volume marketplaces (e.g. Uber 23% and Apple 30%).\\n\\nTake Income establishes a clear earning potential of AKT by means of a network dividend instead of relying on speculation. For an industry that is expected to be $210 billion in 2022, a 20% Take Income amounts to $42 billion in income at 100% market penetration.\\n\\nAs the network grows in adoption, the consistent income-generating potential of AKT will attract liquidity, leading to higher subsidies. With a transparent way to measure performance, one may quantify network value.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nAkash\u2019s blockchain provides a shared state for decentralized control planes and the Akash Token bootstraps the market \u2014 this powerful combination unlocks network effects to accelerate adoption in an open ecosystem.\\n\\nBy leveraging the power of a free market and a permissionless, open cloud, Akash Network will unlock 85% of cloud compute capacity in 8.4 million data centers currently underutilized.

We were early believers in Cosmos, and as the Cosmos Hub grew and attracted more developers, we saw an increasing need for simplicity and scalability that comes with serverless computing and a decentralized infrastructure to support that growth. For us, joining Cosmos was ideal because of Tendermint\u2019s iteration speed and community momentum.\\n\\n**Proving It Works**\\n\\nTo gain market proof for our decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace, we launched our&nbsp;[Founding Member Rewards Program](https://akash.network/blog/congratulations-to-founding-member-challenge-contributors-still-time-to-join-for-5500-akash-tokens/), a series of challenges over a one month period designed to show contributors how to become a cloud provider and how to deploy applications in our decentralized Supercloud. The program involved 3 progressively difficult challenges along with bonus challenges, and contributors joined from all over the world, including the U.S., Korea, Japan, China, Europe, India, and South America. We were excited by the incredible community engagement, with 45 providers and nearly 1,700 applications completed on the first Akash testnet.\\n\\nContributors lit up our Twitter with&nbsp;[praise](https://akash.network/l/love)&nbsp;for our documentation and ease of deployment. In user interviews conducted by a top partner network, 40 out of 100 developers shared that Akash had the best developer experience and documentation. We prioritize exceptional&nbsp;[documentation](https://akash.network/docs/), and it was rewarding to get this feedback from the community.\\n\\n**Engaging Top Validators**\\n\\nAkash employs a blockchain secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus model managed by independent Validators, and Validators perform the vital role of providing economic security to the Akash blockchain. Given how essential validators are to building and scaling Akash Network, we announced that Jack Zampolin of Pylon Validation Services and Director of Product at Cosmos, and Sunny Aggarwal, Research Scientist at Tendermint, had joined as advisors. Jack and Sunny are renowned as top Cosmos validators and key contributors to the Cosmos community. We\u2019re fortunate to have their guidance and insights as we scale Akash Supercloud.\\n\\n**Sharing Our Vision**\\n\\nTo share our distinct vision for the future of the cloud, our team contributed to SF Blockchain Week and Packet\u2019s IFX conference late last year. At SF Blockchain Week, I spoke on the Internet 3.0 Decentralize Everything panel, and our CMO Maly Ly shared branding and marketing best practices on the Blockchain in Marketing Panel. Our team also participated in the 3 day DeFi hackathon. At Packet\u2019s IFX 2019 conference in Las Vegas, I presented a keynote, \u201cThe Unstoppable Stack\u201d on building the world\u2019s first open, permissionless, sovereign, and secure supercloud and marketplace.\\n\\n**Unveiling the Akash Supermini**\\n\\nDuring my keynote at Packet, I unveiled the Akash Supermini, our plug-and-earn portable server and the world\u2019s most powerful in-home supercomputer. The Supermini gives developers full sovereignty over their data and a path to avoiding costly cloud service providers. Users can also plug and earn their favorite cryptocurrencies and offer the device\u2019s unused compute directly on the Akash marketplace. Looking towards the future, the Akash Supermini will also serve as a potential inference layer for new networks leveraging IOT devices like Helium for instance.\\n\\n**Building the Dream Team**\\n\\nGetting closer to the future of the cloud requires a deeply experienced, passionate, and committed team. Last year, Boz Menzalji joined as General Manager and Maly Ly joined as Chief Marketing Officer. A serial entrepreneur and business development leader, Boz has seen two acquisitions and previously was GM at Refereum, a blockchain-based gaming rewards and marketing platform. At Refereum, Boz successfully listed the $RFR token on three new crypto-exchanges with a collective daily volume of $30+ million. As Akash\u2019s GM, Boz orchestrates and scales operational strategy, business development, infrastructure, and processes to enable the successful acceleration of our platform.\\n\\nAn award winning marketing leader, Maly has 18 years of experience accelerating growth and brand awareness across data-driven technology platforms and interactive entertainment companies including Eventbrite, AdRoll, Relativity Space, and Lucasfilm. She has scaled three early stage startups to $150+ million annual recurring revenue, and brought beloved consumer brands including Star Wars, Tomb Raider, and Nintendo to millions of people globally. At Akash, Maly leads acquisition and retention, and works with our team to build a brand that inspires people around the world with the possibilities of the first permissionless and open cloud.\\n\\nJoining Maly on the marketing team is Michael Gushansky, a top sales and customer service performer who comes to us from the events and auto industries. As Marketing and Community Manager, Michael leads our community efforts and scales our marketing functions.\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922312-img4cf96ee494c5-1.jpeg)\\n\\n**Looking Ahead To 2020**\\n\\nIn 2019, we proved that our platform worked \u2013 providers offered their unused compute through our decentralized marketplace, and developers seamlessly deployed applications in our Supercloud. Through many conversations with data centers, and organizations with greatly increasing needs for cloud compute at lower costs, like machine learning companies, we\u2019ve identified specific markets where Akash\u2019s platform could save them up to 90% on their costs.\\n\\n2020 will be the year we launch our market-ready platform to onboard and support customers and services. We\u2019ll be launching our incentivized testnet, unlocking liquidity, and continuing to partner with validators and delegators. We\u2019re excited to continue growing our community of builders as we transition to our Mainnet.\\n\\nAs we expand technical infrastructure and services, we\u2019ve been working with Alex Ellis to bring OpenFaaS to Akash Network. With 20,000+ stars on GitHub,&nbsp;[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/)&nbsp;is an open-source alternative to serverless computing that is gaining wide adoption.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll also be focused on expanding our network of in-home cloud compute providers through the development and launch of the Akash Supermini, the world\u2019s most powerful portable plug-and-earn server and in-home supercomputer. Through the Supermini, anyone can become an income generating in-home cloud compute provider on Akash\u2019s Supercloud. If you haven\u2019t already,&nbsp;[**reserve yours now**](https://akash.network/supermini/reserve)&nbsp;as initial quantities are limited.\\n\\nI want to extend a tremendous thanks to our team, partners, validators, and investors, who have continued to believe in our vision and support us on our journey to creating a permissionless, open, and secure future for the cloud. We want to create a future where architects and builders of the internet have greater freedom to innovate, and where people around the world can be ensured sovereignty over their data.\\n\\nIn 2020, we look forward to getting much closer to this future vision of the cloud.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Closer to the Future of the Cloud in 2020&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In an industry dominated by three cloud providers, the largest of which was featured in a galvanizing&nbsp;New York Times article&nbsp;this past December, we knew that we were taking on much larger incumbents, and a huge challenge, one that could shape the future of the cloud, and thus, the Internet.

Overall, there is a movement to sovereignty\u2013of platform, technology, data, privacy, and cost. We\u2019re also seeing new technologies and devices leverage infrastructure, crypto incentives, and the edge in-home.\\n\\nAs we look to 2020, we see six key trends set to transform the future of the cloud.\\n\\n**1.&nbsp; Cost Sovereignty**\\n\\nAccording to RightScale\u2019s 2019 State of the Cloud report, increased cloud usage has made cloud cost optimization the top priority for three consecutive years. For enterprises, the top responsibility of central IT is managing and reducing cloud services costs. By implementing multi-cloud/hybrid cloud strategies, companies can optimize for services and providers best suited to their needs and budget. Additionally, containerization technologies like Kubernetes provide hybrid cloud platforms with more workload portability and the ability to scale those workloads across different development environments, providing even more flexibility to optimize costs.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Containerization**\\n\\nContainerization gained steam with the opensource Docker engine and Kubernetes by enabling developers to build faster and more secure apps. Larger companies are overwhelmingly choosing to utilize containers, with Kubernetes adoption reaching 60% and Docker adoption reaching 66%[1](https://blog.akash.network/2020/01/09/six-trends-transforming-cloud-computing-in-2020/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-520). We\u2019re also seeing many users opting for container-as-a-service products from their cloud service provider. AWS container service reached 44% adoption in 2019 and Microsoft Azure\u2019s container service grew from 20% to 28% adoption in 2019[2](https://blog.akash.network/2020/01/09/six-trends-transforming-cloud-computing-in-2020/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-520). As containerization technologies like Kubernetes matured and commoditized software, companies are becoming more comfortable running their own data centers and serverless is picking up wider adoption.\\n\\n3.&nbsp;**Serverless Computing**\\n\\nYear over year, serverless has been the top growing extended cloud service, with a 50% increase over 2018 (24% to 36% adoption)[3](https://blog.akash.network/2020/01/09/six-trends-transforming-cloud-computing-in-2020/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-520).&nbsp;[OpenFaaS](https://openfaas.com/)&nbsp;is an open-source alternative to serverless computing that is gaining adoption, with well over 20,000 stars on GitHub. With OpenFaaS, you don\u2019t need a major cloud provider to develop and deploy serverless applications. OpenFaaS has even begun supporting machine learning frameworks which have typically only run through major cloud providers. In the coming year, we\u2019re going to see a growing number of machine learning companies bypass major cloud providers to deploy serverless through companies like OpenFaaS.\\n\\n**4\\\\. Machine learning**\\n\\nMachine learning is the fastest growing segment in the serverless space. Machine learning companies are building applications with the potential to solve a wide range of problems from slowing climate change to transforming healthcare. According to Zion Market Research, machine learning spend will grow from $1.58 billion in 2017 to $20.83 billion in 2024. As machine learning requires a lot of data to make the best inferences possible, cloud computing costs will become even more important to manage for machine learning companies. 2020 will see a shift in the way machine learning companies structure their cloud strategies.\\n\\n**5\\\\. Edge Infrastructure**\\n\\nWith an increasing number of IoT devices globally, bringing computation closer to where it\u2019s needed subsequently saves bandwidth and decreases latency. New in-home networks leveraging and supporting the IOT are emerging with increased frequency. Helium, for instance, is a peer-to-peer wireless long range network that allows IoT devices to securely and inexpensively connect and send data to and from the Internet. The&nbsp;[Akash Supermini](https://akash.network/supermini/)&nbsp;is a powerful and portable in-home server that acts as an inference layer for IoT devices. The infrastructure edge will enable a growing number of devices like Helium and the Akash Supermini to be deployed in-home, which will play a critical role in the transition from wired to wireless infrastructure. According to the 2020 State of the Edge report, it\u2019s projected that over $700 billion will be spent on edge infrastructure and data center facilities in the coming decade.\\n\\n**6\\\\. Proof of Stake**\\n\\nWith the current market cap for PoS cryptocurrencies at $10 Billion and over $6 billion locked in staking, and the rapid growth of PoS networks like Tezos and Cosmos, we\u2019re seeing a fundamental shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake as a consensus model for blockchain[4](https://blog.akash.network/2020/01/09/six-trends-transforming-cloud-computing-in-2020/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-520). PoS networks like Tezos and Cosmos are decoupling from speculative cryptocurrency fluctuations as the performance of their coins is based on the health of their ecosystem, creating income generating digital asset classes. Proof of Stake crypto incentives enable infrastructure and edge technology innovations like Helium and Akash Supermini to subsidize early supply and market adoption.\\n\\n1.

Our CEO Greg Osuri will be presenting the Keynote session \u201cThe Unstoppable Stack\u201d at 2pm to 2:30pm in the Great Hall. He\u2019ll be sharing how we\u2019re building the world\u2019s first open, permissionless, sovereign, and secure supercloud and marketplace, and making it unstoppable.\\n\\nWhat does Greg mean by Unstoppable? Find out in the Q&amp;A below, and don\u2019t miss his Keynote on Wednesday to learn more!\\n\\n**Quick Q&amp;A with Greg Osuri, Cofounder &amp; CEO of Akash Network**\\n\\n**What is your principle behind \u201cUnstoppable\u201d?**\\n\\nThe principle behind Unstoppable is fully sovereign cloud infrastructure that cannot be challenged or taken down by adversaries and hackers. It\u2019s a system designed without assuming trust. Today, you assume providers will protect your data and keep your network up, that they have your best interest in mind. How do you plan for the opposite?&nbsp;\\n\\n**How did this shape your development philosophy?**\\n\\nAt Akash, we designed a cloud with a system that does not incorporate the comfort of assumptions, leveraging Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Users are responsible for peer infrastructure deployment. If a node or institution goes down, another node can pick it up.

Validators are essential to ensuring the sovereignty and security of Akash\u2019s platform. In recognition of their importance in our ecosystem, we recently&nbsp;[announced a grant of 20% delegation power for the first 10 genesis cohort of validators](https://akash.network/blog/an-invitation-to-akash-validators-genesis-10/)&nbsp;who commit to Akash Network.\\n\\nSunny\u2019s deep commitment to community and to teaching, along with his role as Research Scientist at Tendermint/Cosmos, perfectly positions him as an invaluable advisor and guide as we scale the world\u2019s first open, permissionless, and secure supercloud and marketplace for serverless computing.\\n\\nRead on to learn more about Sunny\u2019s remarkable trajectory from pirate ship to the Cosmos.\\n\\n**Q&amp;A with Sunny**\\n\\n**Is it a pirate\u2019s life for you?**\\n\\nHaha, that profile picture is from back when I was a student at Berkeley, and was running for the student government.&nbsp; Heavily dissatisfied with the existing political parties in UC Berkeley student politics, a few friends and I created a new Pirate Party.&nbsp; While a bunch of the other candidates were taking it very seriously, we were just having fun with it. We had a pirate ship on the main plaza fountain, and we challenged people to sword fights while blasting the soundtrack to \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d.&nbsp; But we also had a serious message too, which people liked, and so come election day, we ended up winning a seat! In today\u2019s political world, we\u2019re in one of the most advanced memetic conflicts, and I think ideas win through not only their merit, but a combination of merit and memetic contagion\u2013something I think segments of the crypto space have understood quite well.\\n\\n**How did you get into blockchain?**\\n\\nAs a freshman at Berkeley in 2015, I was studying Computer Science and Political Economy, and got interested in Bitcoin as a way of exploring the intersection of the two. I\u2019ve learned that when I want to learn something, I sign up to teach it. That way, I better learn it! At Berkeley, there\u2019s this cool program called Decals, where students can teach courses. Two friends and I decided to create a course called the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Decal, where we taught about the mechanics of blockchains. The same semester, we started the Blockchain at Berkeley organization, bootstrapping a lot of the initial members from the students in the Decal course. The summer after Sophomore year, I got really engrossed with Proof of Stake, which led me to learning about Tendermint. I reached out to them to help out, and come fall, I was so enthralled that I dropped out of school to work on Tendermint and Cosmos full time.\\n\\n**Why did you decide to become a Validator?**\\n\\nWatching the Bitcoin scaling debates a few years ago, I saw there was a definite split between the miners and core developers, and that was a large cleavage where the battle lines were drawn. I wanted to become a validator to be able to wear both hats, such that if conflicts arise, I can have an understanding and appreciation for the viewpoints of both sides. Having the mindset of a validator also helps me make better design and architectural decisions, as I am simultaneously a user of my software and systems.\\n\\n**How did you become the #1 Validator on Cosmos?**\\n\\nI think it is likely a combination of factors. Sikka is a community-oriented validator; we don\u2019t take in delegation from large known funds for example, but rather from completely anonymous individuals throughout the community.&nbsp; Both myself and my partner, Dev Ojha (valardragon), have contributed heavily to the core software of Cosmos, such as Tendermint Core and the Cosmos SDK. We are able to use our specialized knowledge of the core software to provide insight and improve the security and service for our delegators.\\n\\nFor example, prior to the Kava re-launch, we were able to identify a misconfiguration of the genesis file, which would have gotten many validators slashed. We were able to sound the alarm bells in order to halt the launch and fix the issue, allowing launch to go forward smoothly. We also, going along with the community theme, initially charged a 0% commission for a few months after launch, which likely attracted a number of delegators.&nbsp; However, after feedback from the community through discussions and a governance proposal we created, we increased the commission rate, after which we still saw the vast majority of delegators stick with Sikka. We are currently working on a project called the SikkaDAO, in order to give more say on the validator to the Sikka delegators.\\n\\n**As Research Scientist at Tendermint, what projects coming into the Cosmos ecosystem are you excited about?**\\n\\nThere are a bunch of projects building on Cosmos that I\u2019m really excited about. I think there\u2019s a bunch of cool DeFi primitives being built on Cosmos SDK chains right now, such as Kava\u2019s multi-collateral CDP system, Microtick\u2019s short-term options/price discovery platform, and Chorus One\u2019s Quicksilver project. The Cosmos architecture has a very particular mindset when it comes to designing systems. I think maybe the best way to describe it is to take a \u201clocalist\u201d view of interoperating entities. Cosmos chains normally provide their own security, and then users create interaction stories between chains that take into view each chain\u2019s security, instead of the Cosmos Hub trying to provide a single global security set.\\n\\nIt\u2019s interesting to see this system integrated with other mechanisms in Cosmos projects such as the Agoric smart contracting system and the Kira Dex design. Finally, while building defi and smart contracting is awesome, it\u2019s also great to see more practical projects with real world use cases and users. For example, Lino and of course, the Akash Network. A lot of the open source tooling built by the Akash team is super awesome with immediate real-world usage in DevOps workflows, and it\u2019s exciting to see it all come together in a fully decentralized cloud platform like the Akash Network.\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Cosmos Validator Sikka aka Sunny Aggarwal of Tendermint/Cosmos Joins Akash as Advisor&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Last week, we announced that Jack Zampolin of Pylon Validation Services and Tendermint joined Akash as an Advisor, and today, we\u2019re excited to announce that the number one Cosmos validator Sikka aka Sunny Aggarwal of Tendermint/Cosmos has joined Akash as an Advisor.

AKT has three primary functions.\\n\\n1.&nbsp;**Resolve:**&nbsp;Akash relies on a blockchain where a group of validators vote on proposals. Each proposal is weighed by the proposer\u2019s voting power, which is the total tokens they staked and the tokens bonded to them (anyone can delegate their stakes voting power to validators).\\n\\n2.&nbsp;**Reward:**&nbsp;Providers on Akash stake tokens to subsidize operating and capital expenditures. Stakers are rewarded proportional to the number of tokens staked, the length of lockup time, and the overall tokens staked in the system. Lock up times can vary anywhere from one month to one year.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Reserve:**&nbsp;Fees on Akash can be settled using a multitude of currencies, however, the market order book uses Akash Token (AKT) as the reserve currency of the ecosystem. AKT provides a novel settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and the settlement currency. This way, providers and tenants are protected from the price volatility of AKT expected to result from its low liquidity.\\n\\n### **Income Sources (Earnings)**\\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922421-annual-inflation-1.png)\\n\\nAnnual inflation over the years when tokens are locked with long and short commitments\\n\\nUnder certain network conditions, a validator can earn anywhere between 56% APR to 176.5% APR depending on tokens locked up, time committed, and various mining strategies (liquidate mining compensation or re-stake mining compensation). The high inflation reaches asymptotically to zero in 10 years.\\n\\nThe implicit value of AKT depends on its earning potential from the below income sources:\\n\\n**1\\\\. Transaction Fees:**&nbsp;Every transaction on the blockchain is subject to a small fee (gas fee). A typical deployment takes ~10 transactions. See the&nbsp;[design spec](https://akash.network/docs/overview/design#transactions)&nbsp;for details.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Make (selling compute) and Take (buying computing) Fees:**&nbsp;Every trade on Akash is subject to maker and taker fee. (Sec 5.D in&nbsp;[Economics paper](https://akash.network/static/akash-econ.pdf)).\\n\\n**3\\\\. Commission:**&nbsp;Akash\u2019s blockchain allows for 128 validators in the first year (that\u2019ll increase to 442 in 10 yrs). Validators charge a commission to delegators (Sec 3 in&nbsp;[Economics paper](https://akash.network/static/akash-econ.pdf)). Check out the&nbsp;[Cosmos commission rates](https://www.mintscan.io/validators)&nbsp;to get an idea. The fee structure is fully governed by validators and subject to change if the community votes to change it.\\n\\n### **Network Demand**\\n\\nThe earnings are proportional to marketplace activity, naturally depends on sufficient demand-supply equilibrium. Initially, we use inflation to bootstrap supply in our marketplace by borrowing from the future ([more on bootstrapping supply in a 2-sided marketplace framework here](https://akash.network/blog/bootstrapping-a-free-market-by-borrowing-from-the-future/)).\\n\\nWhen there is not sufficient demand, we use inflation to reward participation. We solve the supply problem by bootstrapping organic demand from the market that creates an attractive incentive for buyers \u2014 up to 10x lower cost than market in early stages.\\n\\nThis is extremely attractive to cost-sensitive applications such as Machine learning.\\n\\n### **The Journey Ahead**\\n\\nOur current focus partnering with validators to secure the Akash Network blockchain and to grow our community of builders.

This accelerated growth is tied to increased consumer demand for throughput and content, a global surge of smartphones, rapid development of web and mobile applications, and high costs of DevOps for on-premise server management.\\n\\nCurrent services are inflexible and come at a high recurring cost with lock-in agreements. Outside of the large incumbent providers, organizations do not have many options for cloud computing. With an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized and accelerated global demand for cloud computing, there is a critical need for flexibility, cost management, and automation. The cloud needs to evolve to a more distributed and decentralized infrastructure for greater flexibility, efficiency, and security.\\n\\nIn parallel, new innovations such as serverless technology is a paradigm shift in computing, freeing developers from set-up and server management, and enabling them to manage the resources needed to run applications.\\n\\nAs the Cosmos hub continues to grow and attract a diverse set of developers, we see the increasing need for simplicity and flexibility that serverless computing brings and a decentralized infrastructure that supports this growth.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why&nbsp;[Akash](https://akash.network/)&nbsp;is bringing serverless computing to&nbsp;[Cosmos](https://hub.cosmos.network/), and better enabling the builders of today and tomorrow. Akash is the world\u2019s first peer-to-peer supercloud for serverless computing, offering developers an open, permissionless, and secure marketplace for unused compute cycles.\\n\\nOn Akash, anyone with a computer can become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace.\\n\\nThrough Akash\u2019s platform, developers can easily and securely access cloud compute at 10x lower cost than the current market providers (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure). The platform achieves these benefits by integrating advanced&nbsp;[containerization](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/21/overclock-labs-bets-on-kubernetes-to-help-companies-automate-their-cloud-infrastructure/)&nbsp;technology with a unique staking model to accelerate adoption, built on Tendermint and Cosmos.\\n\\n### **Akash <3s Cosmos**\\n\\n[Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/)&nbsp;attracted us because of its flexibility as a library with a modular and pragmatic design. We chose to build on Tendermint because of its iteration speed and community momentum. As a Go library, it was a natural fit in our&nbsp;[stack](https://github.com/ovrclk).\\n\\nWe\u2019re drawn to innovations that enable us to iterate and deploy quickly and without friction, and that enable us to increase efficiency. We made a bet on&nbsp;[kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-JSQpScYck&amp;t=4s)&nbsp;in 2014 and now 80% of the cloud is deployed on kubernetes. We made a bet on Cosmos SDK in&nbsp;[2018](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/commit/ce720c089ad2f33408abe32ac514a29a81f6a3c1)&nbsp;and it\u2019s exciting to see its continued rapid growth and adoption.\\n\\nOur economic model is built on the foundation laid down by Cosmos. We\u2019ve developed a serverless cloud that is the most interoperable to date. Akash serves as a gateway for developers to leverage and connect with other decentralized services, such as&nbsp;[NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/)&nbsp;for key management,&nbsp;[Storj](https://storj.io/)&nbsp;for cloud storage, and&nbsp;[Handshake](https://handshake.org/)&nbsp;for domain name services, with the least amount of friction possible.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe way it works is simple:\\n\\n1.  Developers define their needs in a&nbsp;[simple contract language called SDL](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/tree/master/sdl).\\n    \\n2.  They place an order on the marketplace for which the providers bid for workloads, thereby guaranteeing the lowest price possible and this pricing happens using a native token, the AKT.&nbsp;\\n    \\n\\nOnce a lease is created, deployments happen automatically and settlement happens using a multi-token mechanism \u2013 we accept different tokens for fee settlement. For example, if you use NuCypher with Akash Network, you can pay using Bitcoin and have it swapped for NU without any effort on your end.\\n\\nFor the Cosmos community, we provide a production-ready&nbsp;[open-source stack](https://github.com/ovrclk/stack)&nbsp;for bare metal. We recently open-sourced Akash Stack, a secure, scalable, and standardized software stack for developing, delivering, and debugging decentralized networks. We are exploring future payment support for stablecoins.\\n\\n### **The Akash Token (AKT)**&nbsp;\\n\\nThe Akash Token (AKT) performs three main functions,&nbsp;_Resolve_,&nbsp;_Reward_, and&nbsp;_Reserve_:\\n\\nThe AKT token is used to achieve economic security, incentivize early adoption, and normalize exchange rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\n**Resolve:**&nbsp;For governance, Akash relies on a blockchain where a set of validators vote on proposals. Each proposal is weighed by the proposer\u2019s voting power, which is the total tokens they staked and the tokens bonded to them (stakers can delegate voting power to validators).&nbsp;\\n\\n**Reward:**&nbsp;Providers on Akash stake tokens to subsidize operating and capital expenditures. Stakers are rewarded proportional to the number of tokens staked, the length of lockup time, and the overall tokens staked in the system. Lock up times can vary anywhere from one month to one year. Flexibility in lockup encourages stakers that stake for shorter periods (bear markets), in a self-adjusting inflationary system that is designed to optimize for lower price pressure during bear markets.\\n\\n**Reserve:**&nbsp;Fees on Akash can be settled using a multitude of currencies, however, the market order book uses Akash Token (AKT) as the reserve currency of the ecosystem. AKT provides a novel settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and the settlement currency. This way, providers and tenants are protected from the price volatility of AKT expected to result from its low liquidity.\\n\\n### **The Journey Ahead**\\n\\nOur current focus is to partner with great validators to secure the Akash Network blockchain and to grow our community of builders and developers.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re a validator, or interested in becoming one, find out how you can earn 56% APR to 176% depending on AKT\u2019s locked up, trade factor and lockup time.\\n\\n[Find Out More About Akash\u2019s Validator Program](https://akash.network/validators)\\n\\n### **Join Us to Build the Future of the Cloud!**\\n\\n**Riot:**&nbsp;[**https://akash.network/chat**](https://akash.network/chat)\\n\\n**Telegram:**&nbsp;[**https://t.me/AkashNW**](https://t.me/AkashNW)\\n\\n**Twitter:**&nbsp;[**https://twitter.com/akashnet\\\\_**](https://twitter.com/akashnet_)\\n\\n**Github:**&nbsp;[**https://github.com/ovrclk**](https://github.com/ovrclk)&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Decentralized Serverless Computing Coming to Cosmos&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In a market expected to exceed $198 billion by 2024, the leading cloud providers\u2013Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure\u2013dominate the market with 56% market share, and this figure is expected to increase.

In a free market, the prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by external forces.&nbsp;  \\n\\n> \u2026the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord. Every man\u2026is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest in his own way\u2026. The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty \\\\[for which\\\\] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society\\n\\n\\\\-- Adam Smith, The Wealth Of Nations, Book IV, Chapter IX\\n\\n  \\nFor a market that relies on network effects to unlock value, it\u2019s critical to sustain demand or supply until equilibrium is achieved. We\u2019ll present a model where an inflationary system is leveraged to create the effects of liquidity (counterparties at a reasonable price) and bootstrap demand.  \\n\\nFor a truly free market to be possible, it\u2019s critical that the market remains permissionless and self-sovereign with an open ecosystem or risk&nbsp;[market-failure](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/econ335/out/bator_qje.pdf).  \\n\\n1.  **Permissionless**: Participation does not require anyone\u2019s permission.\\n    \\n2.  **Self-Sovereign**: The price of goods and services is driven purely by market forces and not external forces. Monetary policy that dictates the value of the currency used in the market should be determined by its stakeholders and not external forces.\\n    \\n3.  **Open Ecosystem**: The incentives are distributed fairly to all the participants in the market so they benefit from the prosperity of the market.&nbsp;  \\n    \\n\\n  \\nBackground\\n-------------\\n\\nThis article is derived from&nbsp;[Akash\u2019s Economic Model](https://blog.akash.network/2019/09/25/akash-network-economics). Akash is a permissionless, open, and secure marketplace to trade unused compute cycles.&nbsp;  \\n\\nAkash\u2019s interoperability layer radically simplifies integration with decentralized cloud networks, such as&nbsp;[NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/),&nbsp;[Storj](https://storj.io/), and&nbsp;[Handshake](https://handshake.org/). Each of these systems performs a unique function in an overall solution for a decentralized application.  \\n\\nTo enable a friction-free exchange of value and provide more liquidity, which is essential for automation, Akash enables transacting in a multitude of currencies such as BTC, XRP, ATOM.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe full potential of&nbsp;[Akash Network](https://akash.network/)&nbsp;is unlocked when the system reaches economies of scale. Until then, Akash has to not only sustain supply but also offer compelling incentives to attract buyers. By leveraging this model, Akash is able to offer compute at 10x lower cost than developers are paying in the market \u2014 an extremely attractive value proposition for data-intensive applications.  \\n\\n  \\nEconomic Security by Monetary Sovereignty\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf money is an abstraction that measures value, it\u2019s essential the monetary policy \u2014 that influences the value of money itself \u2014 should act in the best interest of the market it serves.  \\n\\nA native digital currency (token) \u2014&nbsp; whose value is driven purely by market forces \u2014 can provide economic sovereignty when monetary policy is determined by a market\u2019s stakeholders.  \\n\\nBy enabling permissionless commerce without the influence of external forces, a token can be leveraged to establish the economic integrity of the marketplace in low trust environments. Strangers can transact directly with one another without an intermediary (external force) arbitering trust&nbsp; \u2014 truly enabling internet scale.  \\n\\nThis is possible by using a system like Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where the token utility is augmented with the ownership of the network. In a PoS system, the nodes \u201cstake\u201d tokens (collateral) to transact on the blockchain and the chain that represents the majority of the tokens is considered the honest-chain. Each token holds a vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \\n\\nFor example, in a PoS algorithm like&nbsp;[Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/docs/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html), anyone can propose to write to the blockchain as long as 2/3rd\u2019s of the validators approve the transaction. A validator\u2019s voting power (weight) is based on the number of tokens they hold (or the number of tokens delegated to them).\\n\\nPoS networks such as&nbsp;[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/),&nbsp;[Kava](https://www.kava.io/), and&nbsp;[Akash](https://akash.network/)&nbsp;offer on-chain governance models. On-chain governance enables the token holders to have ultimate sovereignty over all aspects of the protocol. The \u201cstake\u201d can also be used as collateral to disincentivize bad behavior.  \\n\\n  \\nSubsidizing Supply using Inflationary Rewards\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe maintainers of the blockchain can be incentivized using a Proof-of-Stake scheme. The incentives could include mined tokens (by means of inflation) and usage fees collected by the network.  \\n\\nTo sustain the market value of the token and attract sufficient liquidity, the value of the token should be derived from its earning potential. Earning potential could be based on commission or subscription-based models. For example, in Akash, the Akash Token (AKT) holders earn income from transactions and usage fees (make and take).  \\n\\nThe network has to offer value (beyond inflation) to its stakeholders or risk insolvency.&nbsp;  \\n\\nIn the early stages of a market economy, when there is no demand-supply equilibrium,&nbsp; there isn\u2019t sufficient demand to attract supply (which in turn affects the buy-side). To solve such a cyclic dependency, the seller can be incentivized for their contribution to the network, in addition to earning income from selling goods in the market.  \\n\\nThe seller earns income regardless of demand. When that additional income can generate expected margins (as when goods are sold), the seller can offer goods at an exponentially lower cost without sacrificing margins to attract demand.&nbsp;  \\n\\nBy effectively de-risking seller participation, we can offer a highly compelling value proposition to attract buyers.  \\n\\nRewards based on contribution\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nSince staking provides economic security to the chain (a critical function of the network) anyone who stakes tokens is eligible to receive a share of the overall income. To encourage long-term participation, stakers who commit to longer terms receive a high portion of the reward compared to stakers who commit to short terms.  \\n\\nAs a primary objective to ensure supply, a staker\u2019s compensation also depends on the supply they commit to the network. Stakers who sell goods or services receive more income than stakers who are not selling but contributing to economic security.  \\n\\nFor example, in Akash, a staker can earn anywhere from 56% APR to 176.5% APR depending on tokens locked up, time committed, and various mining strategies (liquidate mining compensation or re-stake mining compensation).  \\n\\nIn summary, a staker\u2019s contribution is measured by:&nbsp;\\n\\n*   **Locked Tokens**: the number of tokens they stake.&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Trade Factor**: the amount of goods they sell.&nbsp;\\n    \\n*   **Lockup Time**: how long they\u2019re committed to the network.\\n    \\n\\nThe income generated by the network (staking rewards and usage fees) goes into a pool which is distributed to the miners based on their contribution factor.  \\n\\n  \\nA Self Regulating Inflation System\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nSince the goal of the inflation system is to bootstrap the market until a healthy economic equilibrium can be achieved, the inflation rate should asymptotically reach zero on reaching this threshold. The time it takes to reach zero-inflation is variable, as it depends on inflation at a given time. Higher inflation means it\u2019ll take less time to reach zero.&nbsp;  \\n\\nThe inflation rate also depends on lock-up times. Shorter lockup times lead to lower inflation. A self-adjusting inflation rate based on time commitment is critical to providing adequate price-support. In bear markets, when stakers commit for shorter time frames, a lower inflation rate leads to less price pressure. The initial inflation rate should be determined by the desired growth rate of the network. A self-regulating inflation rate based on performance ensures a healthy market value for the token.&nbsp;  \\n\\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45776/1620922422-annual-inflation.png)\\n\\nAnnual inflation over the years when tokens are locked with long and short commitments\\n\\nIn Akash, initial inflation is expected to be 100% APR (with an assumption of 60% of lockup for a year) and asymptotically reaches zero in approximately ten years. Under these conditions, a compute provider offering a server rack is able to generate an income of $790,294 with a net profit of $166,777 in three years by staking $207,972 without having to sell any capacity.&nbsp;  \\n  \\n\\nEffects of Liquidity\\n--------------------\\n\\nA model that grows with inflation relies on attracting sufficient liquidity for the token to retain meaningful value for facilitating trade. the market value of the token is determined by investors speculating on the future earning potential of the token, and the system needs to incentivize investors (speculators) to buy-in.  \\n\\nThis system also minimizes the concentration of wealth \u2013&nbsp; any non-functioning tokens that do not contribute to the essential functions of the ecosystem are taxed by means of inflation. This ensures the efficiency of the economy and discourages pure speculators who hold on to tokens for self-gain without making any meaningful contributions to the prosperity of the network.  \\n\\nIn Akash Network, the Akash Token (AKT)&nbsp; is specifically designed to achieve economic security, incentivize early adoption, and normalize exchange rates. Any AKT not involved in the intended use cases risk dilution of value, given market capitalization remains stable. The fees may be settled in a multitude of tokens, including AKT. AKT holders, however, are discouraged from using it for settlement considering its illiquid nature.  \\n\\n  \\nConclusion\\n-------------\\n\\nAt Akash, we believe that by using the power of a free market, we can unlock 85% of capacity in 8.4 million data centers currently underutilized today. We created the tools to activate an incentive structure that not only fairly distributes but will unlock network effects to accelerate growth.  \\n\\nPlease&nbsp;[subscribe to our newsletter](https://akash.network/newsletter)&nbsp;to stay informed on future articles that might interest you.&nbsp; Also, find us in our&nbsp;[community](https://akash.network/community)&nbsp;if you\u2019d like to continue the conversation.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bootstrapping a Free Market by Borrowing from the Future&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The survival of an early market economy depends on its ability to solve the cyclical dependency of demand and supply until a healthy equilibrium can be achieved to unlock its network effects.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2019-10-07T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Greg Osuri&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.CsLKPbu0.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1568],&quot;height&quot;:[0,915],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/bootstrapping-a-free-market-by-borrowing-from-the-future/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;the-economics-of-akash-network-and-token/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-economics-of-akash-network-and-token&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;With 8.4 million data centers, an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized, and accelerated global demand for cloud computing, Akash aims to create efficiencies in the cloud hosting market through algorithms for allocating compute resources that go to waste in the current market.\\n\\nThe leading three providers \u2014 Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure \u2014 dominate the cloud computing market with 56% market share and this figure is expected to increase. These providers are complicated, inflexible, and restrictive, and come at a high recurring cost with lock-in agreements. Outside of the large incumbent providers, organizations do not have many options for cloud computing.\\n\\nAkash is the&nbsp;_world\u2019s first and only supercloud for serverless computing_, enabling anyone with a computer to become a cloud provider by offering their unused compute cycles in a safe and frictionless marketplace.\\n\\nAt Akash, we believe that for a system to reach (or exceed) the scale of the internet, the system has to improve upon the foundational principles of the internet while solving the apparent inefficiencies inadvertently introduced. So we designed Akash to be an open ecosystem that is censorship-resistant and self-sovereign:\\n\\n*   **Censorship resistant**: Your information is safe and can\u2019t be tampered with (permissionless).\\n    \\n*   **Self-sovereign**: You own and control your assets, identity, and data. Akash is built on a globally consistent state machine (blockchain), publicly maintained and governed by its stakeholders.\\n    \\n*   **Open ecosystem:**&nbsp;Everyone gets value from new contributions. The state being a shared resource, its maintainers (validators that provide economic security) earn income from transaction fees. Providers\u2019 costs are subsidized (for under-utilization) using block rewards, and users get to compute at an exponentially greater capacity at the same cost they were paying before.\\n    \\n\\n[We\u2019re excited to release the economic model for Akash](https://akash.network/l/econ-paper). In this paper, we present an economic system that uses a native currency to solve for volatility (one of the biggest challenges for adoption in crypto) while ensuring economic security of our public blockchain. We also present various strategies to mitigate inherent adoption challenges that face an early market economy \u2014 lack of sufficient demand from the tenants (consumers of computing), which in turn hurts demand because of lack of supply. This is a model that can be applied to any marketplace to bootstrap early supply by subsidizing using inflation (i.e., borrowing from the future).\\n\\nAkash Token (AKT): Resolve, Reward, and Reserve\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Akash Token (AKT) performs three main functions:&nbsp;_Resolve_,&nbsp;_Reward_, and&nbsp;_Reserve_.\\n\\n### **Resolve**\\n\\nAkash relies on a blockchain where a set of validators vote on proposals. Each proposal is weighed by the proposer\u2019s voting power, which is the total tokens they staked and the tokens bonded to them (stakers can delegate voting power to validators).&nbsp;\\n\\n### **Reward**\\n\\nProviders on Akash stake tokens to subsidize operating and capital expenditures. Stakers are rewarded proportional to the number of tokens staked, the length of lockup time, and the overall tokens staked in the system. Lock up times can vary anywhere from one month to one year. Flexibility in lockup encourages stakers that stake for shorter periods (bear markets), in a self-adjusting inflationary system that is designed to optimize for lower price pressure during bear markets.\\n\\n### **Reserve**\\n\\nFees on Akash can be settled using a multitude of currencies, however, the market order book uses Akash Token (AKT) as the reserve currency of the ecosystem. AKT provides a novel settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and the settlement currency. This way, providers and tenants are protected from the price volatility of AKT expected to result from its low liquidity. This paper also presents a method \u201cTransaction Ordering using Consensus Weighted Median\u201d to establish exchange rates without the need for an oracle.  \\n  \\n  \\n**.:**&nbsp;[**Download The Akash Network Token Economic Model to Learn More**](https://akash.network/l/econ-paper)&nbsp;**:.**&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The Economics of Akash Network and Token&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;With 8.4 million data centers, an estimated 85% of server capacity underutilized, and accelerated global demand for cloud computing, Akash aims to create efficiencies in the cloud hosting market through algorithms for allocating compute resources that go to waste in the current market.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2019-09-16T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Greg Osuri&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.GSt_NTsm.png&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,500],&quot;height&quot;:[0,359],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;png&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/the-economics-of-akash-network-and-token/banner-image.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-vs-the-grid/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;akash-vs-the-grid&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\\nAt Akash, we do quite a bit of&nbsp;[thinking](https://docsend.com/view/yvgseww),&nbsp;[writing](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-infrastructure-is-a-moral-imperative-2ec13dc3138d), and&nbsp;[presenting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUGjvs6IsrU)&nbsp;on decentralized infrastructure. It\u2019s our business after all \u2013 Akash is a decentralized marketplace and deployment platform for cloud compute. &nbsp;Using The Akash Network, companies make slack server capacity in their colo and on-prem datacenters available for containerized deployment. As a result, Akash-connected datacenters form a decentralized network of compute providers as an alternative to the hyperscale providers that currently dominate the cloud infrastructure market.\\n\\nWe\u2019re not the only game in town though; several other projects are dedicated to bringing decentralized or distributed compute power to users. &nbsp;And to be clear, we see this as a very&nbsp;[good thing](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/60763191/its-a-good-thing.jpg)&nbsp;indeed. &nbsp;Compute is an essential commodity and the world needs a healthy ecosystem of platforms that allow it to be traded quickly, freely and transparently. This article compares Akash with those other projects and attempts to draw relevant distinctions.\\n\\n### **The Grid Projects: Apples and Oranges**\\n\\nOther players in the decentralized compute space include DFINITY, Golem, 0chain, iExec, SONM, and Hypernet. We will consider them as a group \u2013 let\u2019s call them the Grid Projects \u2013 since they all have a similar approach to aggregating compute power. &nbsp;If you\u2019re interested in specific differences among the Grid Projects, check out&nbsp;[this post](https://medium.com/@hypernet/how-hypernet-compares-to-golem-sonm-iexec-etc-d5aec79e51d6)&nbsp;or maybe&nbsp;[this post](https://themerkle.com/iexec-vs-golem-vs-sonm/)&nbsp;or even&nbsp;[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/7kmqx2/is_iexec_a_direct_competitor_of_golem/)&nbsp;because&nbsp;**those differences aren\u2019t relevant**&nbsp;to a comparison with Akash. Why aren\u2019t those differences relevant? &nbsp;Because Akash\u2019s approach is fundamentally different, so it ends up being an&nbsp;[apples-to-oranges comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges).\\n\\n### **How Akash is Different**\\n\\nEach of the Grid Projects implements a particular variation of a single theme: Grid Computing. &nbsp;In a grid compute model, many devices are connected to form a single \u201cvirtual supercomputer\u201d that is optimal for running&nbsp;**highly parallelizable, short-term batch jobs**&nbsp;like CGI rendering, financial modeling, or DNA sequencing. In some cases, the Grid Projects\u2019 compute occurs on-chain and in some it\u2019s off-chain, but in all cases they require an application to be implemented specifically to run on this single virtual supercomputer.\\n\\nThe Akash Network is fundamentally different because it uses generic compute resources to host Docker containers in which&nbsp;**any cloud workload**&nbsp;can run. &nbsp;Short-term batch jobs like CI/CD pipelines, ETL or Spark jobs? &nbsp;Yep. Long-term workloads like web stacks, application servers, queues, or (this is important) databases? &nbsp;Also yep. Any workload that can run in containers on AWS, GCP, Azure, or your own hardware can be run on Akash without rewriting it to run on a supercomputer. Akash also differs in that users have access to block storage on the servers running its containers. The Grid Projects either only offer compute with no storage at all or object storage \u2013 useful for storing large amounts of unstructured data but not for applications or databases.\\n\\n### **Enter the Blockchain**\\n\\nAnother critical difference between Akash and the Grid Projects is in the use of blockchain. &nbsp;Each of the Grid Projects approaches it slightly differently, but all of them perform compute tasks on chain and so all of them are bound by the performance of their blockchains. &nbsp;And some solve this performance problem better than others.\\n\\nAkash, on the other hand, uses the blockchain to provide an open and transparent marketplace on which generic compute resources are traded. In other words, space on a server is bought and sold on chain, while deployment is off chain in Docker containers, orchestrated by Kubernetes, residing on specific servers, within datacenters with user-specified characteristics such as region, cross-connections, certification level, end-user latency, reputation, and provider identity.\\n\\nAkash\u2019s blockchain marketplace also provides a significant price advantage because each workload is bid on by all providers willing and capable to host it. &nbsp;This auction process is visible to all and the resulting competition will provide downward pressure on prices charged by all providers. Since today\u2019s IaaS providers currently&nbsp;[bring in about US$45B per year](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3815165), all cloud use cases bring in in over US$300B, and the IaaS market is growing at 36%YoY, we believe there is plenty of room for price relief.\\n\\n## **In Summary**\\n\\nThe world needs supercomputers to run batch jobs to solve complex computational problems and the Grid Providers bring this power to the world. So if you need a supercomputer, check them out.\\n\\nHowever, most compute workloads are not complex computational problems that demand supercomputing resources. &nbsp;They\u2019re applications, databases, and batch jobs managed by overworked DevOps engineers with a budget. So if you need to run your enterprise workload on the provider you choose, at a price you want, using familiar and time-tested tooling, check out&nbsp;[Akash](https://akash.network/).\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Akash vs The Grid&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;At Akash, we do quite a bit of&nbsp;thinking,writing, and&nbsp;presenting&nbsp;on decentralized infrastructure.

We\u2019re grateful to the legislature for its leadership in protecting and educating consumers as this innovation proceeds at ever-increasing speed.\\n> \\n> In my opinion, expanding UETA\u2019s definitions of \u201celectronic record\u201d and \u201celectronic signature\u201d to include a record or a signature that is secured through blockchain technology is a no-brainer. Why? Because blockchain is inherently immutable and auditable. In other words, once a record is written to a blockchain, it is there forever; it cannot be altered, and it is visible to anyone with access to the chain. A blockchain is a database that cannot be hacked.\\n> \\n> Furthermore, security is baked in using cryptography. When I sign a record with my public key, it is unalterably attributed to me on the blockchain. This is because a cryptographic key is actually a pair of keys \u2013 a public key seen by everyone joined mathematically to a private key seen only by me. So a bad actor cannot hack a database to steal my password because my private key never leaves my computer.\\n> \\n> However, I\u2019d suggest caution regarding smart contracts. Written contracts are often difficult to understand, but they\u2019re at least theoretically human-readable. &nbsp;Smart contracts on the other hand are written in computer code. As a professional software engineer, it can be difficult for me to understand someone else\u2019s code, to say nothing of a layperson\u2019s ability to do so. And of course, code often has bugs which cause unintended behavior. As a result, there is a greater risk of a person committing to a smart contract that has provisions they, or even the contract issuer, do not fully understand. In my opinion, legislation regarding smart contracts must consider these important characteristics. So, we support the amendments to the bill.\\n> \\n> Again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak and I look forward to collaborating in the future.\\n\\n&nbsp;_Special thanks to @nalesandroakash for helping draft this testimony._&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;My testimony as an expert witness for the first ever blockchain bill (AB 2658) introduced in the state of California&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The most significant hurdle for blockchain today is legislative as US companies today face an uncertain legal regime.

You can learn about Akash to your heart\u2019s content by&nbsp;[visiting our site](https://akash.network/)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[reading our light paper](https://akash.network/paper.pdf)&nbsp;(a friendly version of the traditionally-impenetrable crypto whitepaper), so I\u2019ll dispense with a long description of Akash to focus instead on something more meta:&nbsp;**why**&nbsp;we\u2019re doing this and&nbsp;**how**&nbsp;we\u2019re going to do it.\\n\\n## The Akash&nbsp;tl;dr\\n\\nFirst, in case you didn\u2019t read the whitepaper, here\u2019s&nbsp;**what**&nbsp;we\u2019re doing:\\n\\nOverclock Labs is a company whose projects include the Akash Network. The Akash Network allows companies with idle server capacity (there are a lot of them) to make it available for cloud deployments. Developers who want to deploy to Akash specify their deployment criteria in a declarative file posted to our native blockchain, where it\u2019s picked up and bid on by any provider capable of meeting the criteria. Low bid wins and then the parties move off chain to distribute the workload in Docker containers. Once a workload is live, the agreed-on count of Akash tokens is transferred from the tenant\u2019s wallet to the provider\u2019s wallet on a periodic basis for as long as the workload is live, with all that settlement activity written to chain.\\n\\n## Why Akash?\\n\\nWe\u2019re on a bit of a mission. Today\u2019s cloud infrastructure providers have a real oligopoly, which allows them to charge non-commodity prices for commodity compute,&nbsp;[inhibits real competition](http://www.platformonomics.com/2017/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes/), and crowds out open-source projects. We think that\u2019s wrong. Wrong for companies and individuals that use cloud compute; wrong for their customers to whom costs are ultimately passed; and wrong for society as a whole because one of its basic building blocks is controlled by three huge companies.&nbsp;[I wrote about the situation in more depth here](https://blog.akash.network/2018/03/19/decentralized-infrastructure-is-a-moral-issue/).\\n\\n### Distribute then decentralize\\n\\nWhile the current cryptocurrency landscape is&nbsp;[undeniably fascinating](https://youtu.be/e5nyQmaq4k4?t=42s), the real power of blockchain lies in its ability to create a cryptographically-enforced,&nbsp;**distributed**, and open source of truth.&nbsp;[From banking to real estate to voting to identity to file storage and more](https://hackernoon.com/popular-use-cases-of-blockchain-technology-you-need-to-know-df4e1905d373), we\u2019re entering a technological era where \u201ctrusted\u201d (serious quotes around that one) central sources of truth are not always necessary. Central authorities are inherently vulnerable and even corruptible\u200a\u2014\u200abut even when working as designed they\u2019re not always incented to act on behalf of the communities they serve. So public companies are obligated to&nbsp;[maximize shareholder value](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-worth-so-much-because-aws-is-techs-true-unicorn-2017-04-27), not, say, to work toward fairly-priced cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nA distributed approach is perfect for cloud infrastructure because the ideal cloud is&nbsp;**decentralized**, with thousands of globally-distributed points of presence\u200a\u2014\u200away more than the handful of hyperscale datacenters offered by big providers. So how to build and run this ideal cloud?\\n\\nUsing a centralized approach, we\u2019d make a massive capex investment to build out those points of presence. Instead we use the capacity that\u2019s already present in thousands of companies\u2019 on-prem and colo datacenters.\\n\\nUsing a centralized approach, we\u2019d make a massive opex investment to manage, support, collect/distribute revenue, AND assume liability for the network. Instead we use blockchain to connect providers and tenants as peers and to allow direct payments between peers.\\n\\nUsing a centralized approach, we\u2019d make another massive investment of time and resources to build a new brand that users trust with their workloads. Instead we use blockchain to ensure every marketplace transaction is visible to everyone, including payment histories and adverse events\u200a\u2014\u200aso users can trust facts instead of a brand.\\n\\nIn other words, we\u2019re using blockchain\u2019s natural strength as a distributed and open source of truth to facilitate the development of decentralized cloud infrastructure. Not for nothing, this approach also allows a small project like ours to present a credible alternative to the hyperscale, centralized providers.\\n\\n### Transparency\\n\\n[We are indeed living in interesting times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times). Technology-driven decentralization will affect the social and political domains in unpredictable ways. Token sale-driven funding models will affect which types of projects become viable and how they grow, again in unpredictable ways. And from a purely technological perspective, blockchain is new and will evolve rapidly and unpredictably, with new capabilities forming a feedback loop with social, political, commercial, and of course&nbsp;[regulatory](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-launches-cryptocurrency-probe-1519856266)&nbsp;domains.\\n\\nSo here we are in the&nbsp;[early days of something big](https://www.pcmag.com/article/351486/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-wor), and we\u2019re all (yes all of us) pretty much figuring it out as we go. We\u2019re drawing on historical precedents, making mistakes, enjoying successes, and reasoning our way through innumerable issues. And we\u2019re doing all this while working with a technology that is inherently open and transparent. So we, and the organizations we belong to, must also be open and transparent. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\\n\\nIt\u2019s the right thing to do because we learn from one anothers\u2019 mistakes and successes. It\u2019s the right thing to do because admitting you don\u2019t know something opens a path to learning\u200a\u2014\u200aboth for yourself and for those unwilling to admit it. It\u2019s the right thing to do because investors and customers deserve full information to make effective decisions. It\u2019s the right thing to do because the technology demands it. And, at the risk of hyperbole, it\u2019s right because history needs a contemporaneous record of how this all went down.\\n\\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve made a firm commitment to transparency. The software that drives the Network is still under development, but we\u2019ve open sourced it now.&nbsp;[Follow our progress, warts and all, on GitHub](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/). We actively communicate with our investors and&nbsp;[make our monthly investor letters public](https://github.com/ovrclk/updates/)&nbsp;(full disclosure, we do sanitize them slightly). And more softly, we\u2019re committed to using direct and plain language in all our communication and equally committed to responsiveness with our&nbsp;[growing telegram community](https://t.me/AkashNW). We\u2019re grateful to other transparent projects in the space and look to them for ways to improve. Let\u2019s make transparency a default expectation\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s be brave!\\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Introducing Akash&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;This week we introduced The Akash Network to the world with a press release and the open sourcing of our software.

Unfortunately, this success has also enabled them to build&nbsp;[competitive moats](http://www.platformonomics.com/2017/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes/)&nbsp;around their positions. Large providers\u2019 hyperscale data centers and other infrastructure projects effectively prevent competition by establishing a massive capex barrier for potential competitors. Over time, this has created an oligopoly, which hurts consumers as a whole.\\n\\n**What Is an Oligopoly?**\\n\\nIn a monopoly, one company maintains complete control over a market, keeping all other competitors out. This can be done through regulatory restrictions, such as in the case of local utilities service providers, or simply by being an undisputed leader in a particular field. With an oligopoly, multiple companies maintain that control, keeping others out.\\n\\nAs demand for cloud infrastructure grew, several already-dominant tech businesses were able to use revenue from other lines of business to rapidly scale their infrastructure businesses. That let them capture market share, and build their moats. With&nbsp;[85 percent of enterprises](https://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/cloud-computing-trends-2017-state-cloud-survey)&nbsp;now having a cloud strategy in place, this means that a handful of providers are now powering a large, and growing, chunk of the business landscape.\\n\\n**Why Is It Bad for Society?**\\n\\nCorporate consolidation has become&nbsp;[an ongoing problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/04/12/beyond-united-how-oligopolies-hurt-americans-pocketbooks/?utm_term=.93c6af7aa94a)&nbsp;for consumers, as mergers and acquisitions shrink the number of companies competing in each space. In the cloud computing sector, this cost is first paid by businesses, which then raise prices to finance the software they use to conduct business. This creates a service tax that all consumers must pay. Without real competition to drive down prices, there\u2019s no incentive for large cloud providers to keep costs low.\\n\\nThis \u201ccloud tax\u201d is paid by all members of society, including those who don\u2019t directly use cloud infrastructure at all. The money goes directly to three large corporations whose duties are to their shareholders, not to society. We shouldn\u2019t begrudge their enormous profits or control \u2013 they are behaving precisely as they\u2019re obligated to. But neither should we accept this situation as inevitable.\\n\\n**What Can We Do?**\\n\\nOne small company may not be able to disrupt the space, but working together, multiple companies can. At Akash, our goal is to empower any company that runs its own on-premise or colocated data centers to join our network of cloud providers by simply adding their unused server capacity to the Akash Network. Providers automatically bid to host users\u2019 cloud workloads on an open, transparent marketplace, driving down costs as much as 90 percent.\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, the Akash Network also decentralizes control over cloud infrastructure. So many of the applications we use in our daily lives are run in the cloud, and the data they generate stored in the cloud, that we need to consider whether it\u2019s appropriate for three companies to effectively&nbsp;_control_&nbsp;the cloud. The Akash Network is not controlled by any one entity. All participants \u2013 providers and consumers \u2013 have a role in its governance; all network transactions, including pricing and performance, are open on the blockchain; and the software that runs Akash is open source and available for all to see.\\n\\nOverclock Labs, the team building&nbsp;[Akash](https://akash.network/), believes that compute is a commodity that should be traded in a transparent and free marketplace, priced accordingly, and over which a small number of large companies should not be able to exert control. The Akash Network is the manifestation of these beliefs.&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;Blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Decentralized Infrastructure is a Moral Imperative&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;As businesses across the globe adopt cloud-based infrastructure strategies, three providers (Amazon\u2019s AWS, Google\u2019s GCP, and Microsoft\u2019s Azure) have solidified their positions as dominant players in the $247 billion-dollar cloud infrastructure market.&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[3,&quot;2018-03-19T00:00:00.000Z&quot;],&quot;draft&quot;:[0,false],&quot;categories&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]]],&quot;contributors&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Nick Alesandro&quot;]]],&quot;bannerImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;src&quot;:[0,&quot;/_astro/banner-image.DvzFgAEj.jpg&quot;],&quot;width&quot;:[0,660],&quot;height&quot;:[0,480],&quot;format&quot;:[0,&quot;jpg&quot;],&quot;fsPath&quot;:[0,&quot;/home/runner/work/website/website/src/content/Blog/decentralized-infrastructure-is-a-moral-imperative/banner-image.jpg&quot;]}]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;serverless-is-bigger-than-faas/index.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;serverless-is-bigger-than-faas&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;There is a growing excitement in the developer community around the serverless paradigm, an idea that lets developers to deliver workloads without provisioning or managing servers.\\n\\nAt its core, serverless architecture relies on orchestrating a vibrant eco-system of fully managed services. With increasing number of such backend services \u2014 namely backend-as-a-service (BaaS) \u2014 supported by all the key cloud infrastructure (IaaS) providers, I think it\u2019s fair to say 2018 will be the year of serverless.\\n\\nWith all the excitement, there\u2019s also confusion as to what constitutes to serverless architecture. Conventional wisdom \u2014 catalyzed by cloud providers\u2019 rhetoric \u2014 is that only Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) implementations represent a serverless architecture.\\n\\nI wrote this post to challenge some of those viewpoints in a hope to present a case for expanding this definition beyond functional level abstraction to application level abstraction to be considered as serverless.\\n\\n#### Serverless 1.0\\n\\nThe idea of an absence of the server concept during software development \u2014 or serverless \u2014 is not new. Heroku was perhaps the first to introduce this concept around 2008 that had broad adoption by the developer community (a case can be made about Google App Engine being the first, but will keep that for another post).\\n\\nWith a developer first mentality, Heroku promised three main things:\\n\\n1.  Cheaper, by isolating workloads in much small container images compared to VMs by IaaS providers, optimal to run most application workloads\\n    \\n2.  Comprehensive set of fully managed backends, accessible from a marketplace with federated identity and consolidated billing\\n    \\n3.  Great developer experience using a fantastic command line tool to develop, debug and deliver workloads\\n    \\n\\nFor applications written in a language/framework that Heroku supports and adhere to a simple standard \u2014 called the 12-factor methodology \u2014 developers could follow a very familiar git-based workflow to deploy their code. Heroku would seamlessly handle the availability and scaling of the workloads. The declarative formats of 12-factor methodology promised to maximize iteration speed and provided a clean contract with the underlying OS, offering maximum portability\\n\\nAs containers have much smaller footprint than VMs, they allowed Heroku to efficiently schedule workloads across a diverse set of machines with various configurations and optimize for price-performance.\\n\\nTo make this a reality, Heroku built container runtimes and orchestration engines that ran on top of Amazon Web Services that were closed off from the user.\\n\\nThe simplicity promised by the 12-factor design, however, lacked the flexibility do deploy workloads with complex needs. You couldn\u2019t deploy any workload that was wasn\u2019t 12-factor or have your workloads run in a private network. The marketplace \u2014 being comprised mostly of external vendors \u2014 paid little or no attention to latency between the application and backends that often resulted in degraded performance.\\n\\nThe closed approached, the lack of flexibility and a degraded performance kept Heroku away from being adopted by enterprises with complex needs and drove it to remain as a much-loved platform for \u201chobby\u201d developers.\\n\\nThis gap in the market gave birth to platforms \u2014 called platform-as-as-services (PaaS) \u2014 like CloudFoundry (an EMC and VMWare spin-off), Makara (RedHat OpenShift) and DotCloud (Later renamed to Docker)\\n\\nBy embracing an open approach, these platforms promised the ease-of-use of Heroku style workflows while providing the flexibility or using your own hardware with a focus on simplicity\\n\\nLike Heroku, these platforms also relied heavily upon Linux containers \u2014 a relatively old but unknown concept at the time \u2014 as a packaging and isolation mechanism to deliver workloads. The native container runtime provided by Linux \u2014 called LXC \u2014 was hard and unpleasant to use; limited its adoption to advanced teams at companies like Google and ones building infrastructure tools.\\n\\nDotCloud, a relatively unknown company with a product that couldn\u2019t differentiate from the competition \u2014 facing a possibility of extinction \u2014 open sourced a tool they\u2019ve developed to simplify the use to LXC called \u201cDocker.\u201d\\n\\nDocker\u2019s key to simplicity was the image format \u2014 contents the image, declared in a manifest file is then used to build an image that can be built anywhere and shared with others by storing in a central repository. This build once, run anywhere approach gave way for developers to solve the particularly tricky, development-to-production parity problem.\\n\\nIt didn\u2019t take long for developers to embrace Docker that lead to a Cambrian exposition of the cloud-native ecosystem. While Docker provided the image format and runtime for a single workload, tools like Kubernetes were born to orchestrate a variety of these workloads and schedule them in a fault tolerant manner.\\n\\nWhat began as a serverless promise by Heroku \u2014 the application runtime abstraction \u2014 paved the way for a thriving ecosystem that changed the fundamental way we design the delivery of distributed workloads\\n\\n#### Serverless 2.0\\n\\nWith increased number of workloads moving to the cloud, it didn\u2019t take long for IaaS providers to understand the value of providing fully-managed backends \u2014 such as databases, caches, load balancers, etc \u2014 the support infrastructure required by the workloads\\n\\nFor providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), that began with a simple, managed object store offering, expanded into over 70 services (as of the writing of the post); for many providers, a way to orchestrate these rich set backends was evident next step. By leveraging the orchestration and containerization wave, it made it possible to rethink abstraction levels.\\n\\nThis gave birth to a new level of abstraction \u2014 function-as-a-service. AWS Lambda is a product that provides functional abstraction with the same promise of faster iteration speed, zero administration, and a much granular pricing model.\\n\\nThe difference here is that development focus is on a single function or module rather than a service with a large surface area like in the application runtime abstraction.\\n\\nAnother fundamental difference between application level abstraction and functional level abstraction is where and how you define invocation mechanism for workloads. In application abstraction, the invocation mechanism is described in the application code itself and provides the flexibility for the developer to choose the framework. For functional, the invocation is defined in a manifest file designed by provider. In case of AWS Lamda, an asynchronous invocation by placing a message on a managed queue (SQS), and a web-based invocation by calling a predefined endpoint on a managed router (API Gateway)\\n\\nIn essence, FaaS is an application framework created and managed by the provider. This makes FaaS appealing for developers that don\u2019t necessarily care about vendor lock-in and are flexible to adopt the provider\u2019s manifest in exchange for a piece of mind.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nIt\u2019s evident by now that application and functional runtime abstraction deliver the promise of serverless \u2014 a future where developers can focus on writing code that provides functionality to their users instead of dealing with complexities of delivering that code.\\n\\n_This post was originally published on_&nbsp;[_Hacker
