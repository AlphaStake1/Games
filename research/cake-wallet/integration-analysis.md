# Cake Wallet Integration Analysis for Football Squares Treasury

## Key Research Findings

### **❌ No Public API Available**

Cake Wallet does **not** provide public APIs or RPC interfaces for external integration. It's designed as a self-contained, non-custodial wallet app, not a platform for third-party developers.

### **✅ Open Source Advantage**

- MIT Licensed - can fork and modify
- Modular architecture with separate cryptocurrency modules
- Proven implementations for SOL and XMR operations

## Technical Architecture Relevant to Jerry's Wallet

### **Solana Integration (`/cw_solana/lib/`)**

**Key Files:**

- `/cw_solana/lib/solana_wallet.dart` - SOL transaction automation
- `/cw_solana/lib/solana_client.dart` - Multi-destination transfers, batch processing

**Relevant Features for Treasury Overflow:**

```dart
// Automatic SOL transfers
createTransaction() - Multi-destination transfers
_updateBalance() - SOL and SPL token balance monitoring
signSolanaTransaction() - Automated signing capabilities
// "Send all" functionality perfect for overflow operations
```

### **Monero Integration (`/cw_monero/lib/`)**

**Key Files:**

- `/cw_monero/lib/monero_wallet.dart` - XMR operations
- `/cw_monero/lib/monero_wallet_service.dart` - Wallet management

**Relevant Features for Privacy Conversion:**

```dart
// Wallet management for automated operations
create() - Generate new wallets programmatically
restoreFromSeed() - Automated wallet recovery
createTransaction() - Automated XMR transactions
connectToNode() - Custom node connectivity
startSync() / stopSync() - Blockchain synchronization control
```

## Recommended Integration Strategy for Jerry's Wallet

### **Option 1: Fork Integration (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Fork relevant Cake Wallet modules:**
   - `cw_solana` for SOL treasury operations
   - `cw_monero` for XMR privacy operations
   - Core wallet management utilities

2. **Build Custom Treasury Service:**

   ```typescript
   // Jerry's Wallet Service Architecture
   class JerryWalletService {
     // SOL Operations (from cw_solana patterns)
     async receiveOverflow(amount: number): Promise<string>;
     async monitorBalance(): Promise<number>;

     // XMR Operations (from cw_monero patterns)
     async convertToMonero(solAmount: number): Promise<string>;
     async sendToUndisclosedWallet(xmrAmount: number): Promise<string>;
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Monitor Treasury contract events for overflow
   - Automatic SOL transfer to Jerry's wallet
   - Triggered XMR conversion based on percentage rules
   - Privacy-focused transfer to undisclosed wallet

### **Option 2: External Exchange Bridge**

Use Cake Wallet's proven exchange framework patterns with third-party exchanges:

- ChangeNow, SideShift, or similar for SOL→XMR conversion
- Automated conversion triggers based on treasury thresholds
- Less control but faster implementation

## Security Considerations from Cake Wallet

### **Private Key Management:**

- Hardware wallet support integration
- Secure local key storage patterns
- Non-custodial approach (Jerry controls his own keys)

### **Privacy Features:**

- Built-in Tor support for operations
- Proxy configuration capabilities
- Custom node connectivity for both chains

### **Operational Security:**

- Encrypted wallet files
- Secure transaction signing
- Audit trail capabilities

## Implementation Dependencies (from Cake Wallet)

```yaml
# Essential packages for Jerry's wallet
dio: ^5.7.0                    # HTTP client for exchange APIs
solana: ^0.31.0+1             # Solana blockchain operations
socks5_proxy                  # Privacy/proxy support
encrypt: 5.0.2                # Wallet encryption
```

## Practical Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: SOL Treasury Operations**

1. Implement SOL wallet using Cake Wallet's `solana_client.dart` patterns
2. Monitor Treasury contract for overflow events
3. Automatic transfer to Jerry's SOL address

### **Phase 2: XMR Privacy Pipeline**

1. Create XMR receiving wallet using `monero_wallet_service.dart` patterns
2. Integrate with exchange API for SOL→XMR conversion
3. Implement percentage-based conversion rules

### **Phase 3: Undisclosed Transfer**

1. XMR transfer to final destination wallet
2. Privacy-focused operations with Tor integration
3. Complete audit trail for Eric's oversight

## Files to Reference for Implementation

**Cake Wallet Source Files:**

- `/cw_solana/lib/solana_wallet.dart` - SOL automation patterns
- `/cw_solana/lib/solana_client.dart` - Blockchain connectivity
- `/cw_monero/lib/monero_wallet_service.dart` - XMR wallet management
- `/lib/core/wallet_loading_service.dart` - Automated wallet operations
- `/integration_test/funds_related_tests.dart` - Implementation examples

**Next Steps:**

1. Fork relevant Cake Wallet modules
2. Create custom Jerry wallet service
3. Integrate with Football Squares treasury contract
4. Implement conversion and privacy pipeline

## Conclusion

While Cake Wallet doesn't provide direct API access, its open-source architecture provides excellent building blocks for Jerry's automated treasury management system. The fork approach gives us complete control over operations while leveraging battle-tested wallet implementations.
