## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If URLs Stop Working:

1. Check server status: The dev server may have stopped
2. Contact admin for new URLs
3. Try the backup URL if primary fails

### Common Issues:

- **"Site can't be reached"**: Server may be restarting, wait 30 seconds
- **Wallet won't connect**: Ensure you're on HTTPS (use Ngrok URL)
- **Slow loading**: First load compiles assets, subsequent loads are faster

## 📊 Server Status

To check if the server is still running, try:

- Ngrok status: https://b7086201157e.ngrok-free.app
- Bore status: http://bore.pub:7849

Both URLs should return a response. If not, contact the administrator.
