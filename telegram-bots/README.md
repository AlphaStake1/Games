## üîß Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing Individual Bots

```bash
# Test connection and configuration
npm run test

# Send test message (requires chat ID)
npm run test:message
```

### Production Deployment

For production, use webhooks instead of polling:

1. Set up HTTPS endpoint (e.g., using ngrok for testing)
2. Configure webhook URL in `.env`:

```env
USE_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOKS=true
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com
TELEGRAM_PORT=3002
```

3. Start with webhooks:

```bash
npm start
```

## üìä Monitoring

Check bot status:

```bash
# Test all connections
npm run test

# View logs
npm run logs
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

1. **Check token validity:**

```bash
npm run test
```

2. **Verify AI API keys:**

- Ensure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set for Jerry
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set for Coach B
- Ensure GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY is set for OC-Phil

3. **Check network connectivity:**

- Firewall rules for Telegram API
- Proxy settings if behind corporate network

### Authentication Issues (Jerry)

If Jerry's authentication isn't working:

1. Check exact phrase match (case-sensitive)
2. Verify user ID is being stored correctly
3. Check authentication timeout settings

### Webhook Issues

If using webhooks and bots aren't receiving messages:

1. Verify HTTPS certificate is valid
2. Check webhook URL is publicly accessible
3. Use `npm run test` to see webhook status
4. Check Telegram's webhook info for errors
