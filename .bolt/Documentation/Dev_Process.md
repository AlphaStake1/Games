Below is a lean, battle-tested workflow that lets a **solo developer** iterate fast, ship safely, and get the most out of AI helpers (Copilot / Claude / Gemini) without the overhead of a team-oriented process.

At a glance you’ll:

- work exclusively on short-lived feature branches,
- let GitHub + Netlify build every branch into an isolated **Deploy Preview**,
- use AI tools for scaffolding, refactors and docs—but never as the sole reviewer,
- keep main perpetually deployable, versioned and tagged.

## 1 Local development loop

### 1.1 One-command dev server

```bash
netlify dev          # wraps `next dev`, injects env-vars, mocks Functions
```

`netlify dev` mirrors the exact build Netlify runs in CI and gives you a sharable tunnel if you add `--live`. ([docs.netlify.com][1], [docs.netlify.com][2])

### 1.2 Fast Refresh & AI pair-coding

- Tailwind/Next.js hot-reload < 1 s; keep the browser + VS Code side-by-side.
- Prompt Copilot/Gemini for **scaffolding, test stubs, regexes, doc-blocks**—then review line-by-line. GitHub stresses that _you_ remain “editor-in-chief.” ([docs.github.com][3], [github.blog][4])

## 2 Git discipline for a party-of-one

| Step                 | Command                                    | Why                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start work           | `git switch -c feat/<slug>`                | Feature-branch workflow keeps `main` clean. ([atlassian.com][5], [atlassian.com][6])  |
| Commit atomic chunks | `git add -p` → `git commit -m "feat: ..."` | Small commits are easier for AI/code-review tools to summarise.                       |
| Push                 | `git push -u origin HEAD`                  | Triggers a Netlify Deploy Preview automatically. ([netlify.com][7], [netlify.com][8]) |
| Merge                | PR → **Squash & merge**                    | Keeps history linear; Conventional-Commit message becomes the release note.           |

> **Tip:** adopt _Conventional Commits + Semantic Versioning_ so your tags (v1.2.3) and changelog are generated automatically. ([nimafarzin-pr.medium.com][9], [reddit.com][10])

## 3 Netlify automation

### 3.1 Deploy Previews

Every branch/PR gets its own URL (`https://<slug>--preview.netlify.app`); test responsive layouts, share with friends, or run Lighthouse before merging. ([docs.netlify.com][1])

### 3.2 Production deploy

Merge → Netlify **build + test + deploy** → DNS instant-swap. Failed builds never reach users. ([netlify.com][7])

### 3.3 Environment & secrets

`Site settings ▸ Build & deploy ▸ Environment` → add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, keys, etc. The same vars are available in `netlify dev`. ([docs.netlify.com][2])

## 4 Using AI effectively (solo edition)

| Use-case                | Good practice                                               | Why                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generate boilerplate    | “Create React component for ScoreBoard with props … ”       | Saves typing. Review diff before commit.                                  |
| Explain unfamiliar code | `#copilot explain`/Gemini “Explain this hook”               | Builds understanding; catches dead code.                                  |
| Refactor                | Highlight block → “Refactor into hook”                      | Faster but _run tests afterwards_.                                        |
| Docs & commit msgs      | “Write JSDoc for this fn” / “Summarise changes in 50 chars” | Clear history is your future self’s best friend.                          |
| **Never**               | accept large AI patch unreviewed                            | NYU study: 40 % of Copilot security snippets had flaws. ([wired.com][11]) |

## 5 Testing & quality gates

- **unit / integration**: Vitest or Jest + React Testing Library.
- **e2e**: Playwright → run in Netlify CI (`netlify build --context deploy-preview`).
- **lint & typecheck**: `next lint` / `tsc --noEmit` fail the build early.

---

## 6 Release & rollback

1. Merge → Netlify deploys → tag automatically:

   ```bash
   npm version minor   # bumps 1.3.0, creates git tag
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

2. Broken prod? In Netlify, **Deploys ▸ previous build ▸ Restore** (instant).

## 7 Daily driver checklist

| Morning                                    | Evening                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `git pull --ff-only`                       | Merge or stash WIP                |
| `pnpm up -L` → `pnpm lint && test`         | Push feature branch               |
| Start `netlify dev`                        | Draft PR, check Deploy Preview    |
| Short Copilot/Gemini sessions (≤25 tokens) | Write Conventional-Commit summary |

### Key take-aways

- **Feature branches + Deploy Previews** give you prod-level validation without risk.
- Keep **main** always releasable; merge only when Netlify preview looks good.
- Use AI for speed-ups, not blind merges—review everything, run tests.
- Automate: `netlify dev`, one-click rollback, semantic tags = zero hand-holds.

Adopt this solo-centric loop and you’ll iterate as quickly as the code and your AI copilots can keep up, while Netlify ensures only green builds ever reach your users.
