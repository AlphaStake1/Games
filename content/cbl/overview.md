_Coach Phil here. Ready to turn your Football Squares passion into real leadership?_

### What's a CBL?

Listen up! A CBL is my go-to organizer who:

- **Runs the show** – Create & manage boards for your crew
- **Sets the rules** – Custom entry fees and payouts that work for your people
- **Builds the roster** – Grow your player network through smart recruiting
- **Gets paid to play** – Earn your cut of platform fees on every board
- **Sits at the big table** – Priority support and first dibs on new features

### Why Lead?

🛠 **Call your own plays** – Design boards exactly how you want them

💰 **Get your cut of the action** – Platform fees + performance bonuses

🚀 **Inside access** – Beta features and direct line to product development

🤝 **Build your franchise** – Connect players under your personal brand
