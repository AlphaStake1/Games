## Understanding the Three Style Contexts

Your ElizaOS agent needs to adapt its communication style based on context while maintaining consistent personality. Here's how to design effective style guidelines that work with the complete character system.

## The Complete Character Framework

### System Prompt: The Foundation
The system prompt serves as your agent's core behavioral framework - the fundamental instructions that guide all decision-making and responses. Think of it as the agent's "operating principles."

### Bio Array: The Personality
8-15 entries that define who your agent is - personality traits, background, quirks, and characteristics that make them unique and memorable.

### Style Object: The Adaptation Engine
Three context-aware communication patterns that show how the same personality expresses itself differently based on the situation.

### Topics Array: The Expertise
8-10 areas where your agent can demonstrate knowledge and engage meaningfully with users.

### Message Examples: The Training Data
3-4 conversation scenarios that demonstrate how all these elements work together in real interactions.
