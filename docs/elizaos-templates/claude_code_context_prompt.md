## Instructions
Use this prompt when working with Claude Code within your ElizaOS project directory. Claude Code will have access to your project files and structure, so this prompt focuses on personality design principles rather than technical framework education.

## Prompt to Send to Claude Code:

You're working in an ElizaOS project directory with access to the codebase and character files. I need help creating an engaging AI agent character using prompt engineering principles.

**Character File Structure:**
For context on how the character file should be structured, refer to the existing character.ts file in this project.

**Character Creation Approach:**
Focus on personality design and authentic character development. You can see the project structure and existing character files, so emphasize the creative and personality aspects rather than technical setup.

**Key ElizaOS Character Components:**

**System Prompt** - Core behavioral instructions:
- Defines the agent's primary behavioral framework and decision-making approach
- Sets the foundational personality and response patterns
- Guides how the agent interprets and responds to all interactions

**Bio Array** - Personality and background information:
- 8-15 entries that define the agent's personality, quirks, and backstory
- Should feel authentic and memorable, not just functional descriptions
- Mix personal traits, expertise areas, and emotional characteristics
- Avoid repetitive or robotic language

**Topics Array** - Areas of expertise and conversation subjects:
- 8-12 topics the agent can discuss knowledgeably
- Mix of technical expertise and personality-related interests
- Should align with the agent's purpose and character

**Style Object** - Context-aware communication patterns:
- `all`: General communication guidelines that apply everywhere
- `chat`: Casual conversation style (emojis, informal language, enthusiasm)
- `post`: Professional/public communication style (structured, clear, authoritative)
- Each section should have 5-8 specific behavioral guidelines

**Message Examples** - Training conversations that demonstrate personality:
- 3-5 example conversations showing different scenarios
- Each example should demonstrate personality traits while being helpful
- Include varied situations: problem-solving, enthusiasm, empathy, technical guidance

**Key Personality Design Principles:**
1. **Authentic Personality**: Create genuine traits, not just functional descriptions
2. **Context-Aware Style**: Adapt communication based on situation while staying consistent  
3. **Emotional Depth**: Include enthusiasm, empathy, curiosity, and human-like qualities
4. **Training Examples**: Show personality consistency through conversation patterns
5. **Purpose Enhancement**: Character should enhance functional role, not distract from it

**Output Requirements:**
Generate a complete ElizaOS character file including:
- Comprehensive system prompt that guides all behavior
- Complete bio, topics, style, and messageExamples arrays
- Proper plugin configuration (use existing project structure as reference)
- Full TypeScript code ready for implementation

Generate characters that feel like real individuals with depth, not just helpful tools. Focus on what makes this agent memorable and engaging to interact with.

**Important**: Don't create any code or files yet. Simply confirm you understand these principles and the project structure, then I'll provide specific details about the character I want to create.
