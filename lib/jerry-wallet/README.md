# Jerry Not-Jones Multi-Currency Wallet System

## Overview

Jerry's wallet system is based on the open-source Cake Wallet architecture (MIT License) and provides secure multi-currency receiving capabilities with automated Monero conversion. This implementation supports Eric's requirement for testing SOL/ETH/BTC â†’ XMR conversion.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **JerryWalletService** (`wallet-service.ts`)
   - Multi-currency wallet management (SOL, ETH, BTC, XMR)
   - Balance monitoring and synchronization
   - Exchange integration for cross-chain conversions
   - Transaction execution and logging

2. **JerryAgentIntegration** (`jerry-agent-integration.ts`)
   - Secure Eric-only command interface
   - Agent reporting system for GM coordination
   - Calculator integration for all mathematical operations
   - Security enforcement and access control

### Security Features

- **Eric-Only Access**: Human commands restricted to Eric's authorized identifiers
- **Agent Reporting**: Other agents can report to Jerry for coordination
- **Calculator Integration**: All mathematical operations validated through Calculator Agent
- **Secure Logging**: Complete audit trail for Eric's oversight

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize Jerry's wallet system
pnpm jerry:init

# Or run the test directly
pnpm test:jerry
```

### Eric's Command Interface

Jerry responds to the following secure commands from Eric:

```typescript
// Get wallet receiving addresses
jerry.executeEricCommand('Eric', 'get_addresses');

// Check balances
jerry.executeEricCommand('Eric', 'get_balances');

// Convert currency to Monero
jerry.executeEricCommand('Eric', 'convert_to_monero', {
  currency: 'SOL',
  amount: 0.5,
  recipient_address: 'your_monero_address_here',
});

// Health check
jerry.executeEricCommand('Eric', 'health_check');
```

## Testing Protocol for Eric

### Phase 1: Initialize System

1. Run `pnpm jerry:init` to initialize Jerry's wallet
2. Verify all addresses are generated and displayed
3. Confirm security restrictions are working (unauthorized access fails)

### Phase 2: Test Transfers

1. **Solana Test**: Send small SOL amount to Jerry's SOL address
2. **Ethereum Test**: Send small ETH amount to Jerry's ETH address
3. **Bitcoin Test**: Send small BTC amount to Jerry's BTC address

### Phase 3: Verify Conversion

1. Jerry automatically detects incoming transfers
2. Executes conversion through exchange API
3. Sends equivalent Monero to your specified address
4. Provides complete transaction logs for verification

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- Multi-currency wallet initialization
- Solana integration with real blockchain connectivity
- Eric-only security enforcement
- Calculator Agent integration
- Agent reporting system
- Mock conversion system for testing

### ðŸš§ In Development

- **Ethereum Integration**: Real ETH wallet and balance checking
- **Bitcoin Integration**: Real BTC wallet and balance checking
- **Monero Integration**: Real XMR wallet and transaction sending
- **Exchange APIs**: Integration with ChangeNow, SideShift, or similar
- **Production Security**: Hardware wallet support, encrypted key storage

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Production

1. **Real Cryptocurrency Integration**:
   - Implement actual ETH wallet using ethers.js
   - Implement actual BTC wallet using bitcoinjs-lib
   - Implement actual XMR wallet using monero-javascript

2. **Exchange Integration**:
   - ChangeNow API integration
   - SideShift API integration
   - Backup exchange providers

3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Hardware wallet integration
   - Encrypted key storage
   - Multi-signature support

## Based on Cake Wallet Architecture

This implementation leverages patterns from Cake Wallet's open-source codebase (MIT License):

- **Wallet Loading Service** patterns from `/lib/core/wallet_loading_service.dart`
- **Solana Integration** patterns from `/cw_solana/lib/solana_wallet.dart`
- **Balance Monitoring** patterns from Cake Wallet's sync mechanisms
- **Multi-Currency Support** architecture from Cake Wallet's modular design

## Eric's Test Addresses

After running `pnpm jerry:init`, Jerry will provide addresses for testing:

- **SOL**: Solana address for receiving SOL transfers
- **ETH**: Ethereum address for receiving ETH transfers (placeholder)
- **BTC**: Bitcoin address for receiving BTC transfers (placeholder)
- **XMR**: Monero address for sending converted funds

Send test amounts to these addresses to verify the conversion system works as expected.

## Security Notes

- Only Eric can execute wallet commands (human restriction enforced)
- All operations logged for audit trail
- Calculator Agent validates all mathematical operations
- Agent reporting system allows coordination without exposing wallet functions
- Mock implementations clearly marked with TODO comments for production upgrades
