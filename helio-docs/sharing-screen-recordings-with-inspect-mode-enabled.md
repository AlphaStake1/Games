To effectively help the Helio support team diagnose and resolve issues, you may be asked to provide screenshots or a screen recording with your browser's "Inspect Mode" enabled. This allows the team to see valuable debugging information from the "Network" and "Console" tabs.

### General Steps:

1.  **Open Developer Tools:** Use the specific shortcut for your browser and operating system.
2.  **Navigate to Tabs:** Click on the "Network" and "Console" tabs in the developer panel.
3.  **Reproduce the Issue:** Reload the page and perform the actions that cause the problem, keeping the developer panel open.
4.  **Capture:** Take screenshots or a video of the entire process, ensuring the developer panel is clearly visible.
5.  **Share:** Attach the captured files to your support ticket on Discord or Telegram.
