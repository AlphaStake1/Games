Helio Wallet simplifies the onboarding process for new crypto users by enabling card-to-crypto payments at checkout.[1] It is a self-custody wallet on the Solana blockchain, secured by Web3auth, which allows users to log in with their email or social accounts without needing a seed phrase or browser plugins.[1] It is important to note that losing access to your email will result in losing access to your wallet.[1]

### Onramper - Pay with Card

Helio's on-ramp feature allows buyers to create and fund a Helio Wallet directly at checkout.[1] Onramper routes customers to the most suitable on-ramp provider based on their region, currency, and top-up method, and it remembers previous preferences to optimize success rates.[1]

- **Payment methods**: Credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, Paypal, Google Pay, and over 130 other methods are supported.[1]
- **Providers**: More than 20 on-ramp providers are available, including Moonpay, Stripe, and Revolut.[1]
- **Regions**: The service is available in over 190 countries.[1]
- **Conversion**: The platform boasts industry-leading transaction success rates.[1]

The "Pay by card" option is enabled by default on Solana payments, but it can be disabled or set as the primary call to action.[1]

### Auto Off-Ramp for Merchants

Merchants can receive their crypto earnings directly into their bank accounts through a designated "liquidation wallet address".[1] This feature requires additional KYC verification and linking a bank account to the liquidation address, a process facilitated by Helio's partner, Bridge.xyz.[1] To set this up, you need to complete a form, and the Helio team will assist you.[1]

- **Off-ramp currencies per chain**:
  - **Solana**: USDC, PYUSD
  - **Ethereum**: USDC, USDT, PYUSD
  - **Base**: USDC
  - **Polygon**: USDC[1]
- **Fee**: 0.50%[1]
- **Supported transfer methods**: SEPA, WIRE, and ACH[1]
