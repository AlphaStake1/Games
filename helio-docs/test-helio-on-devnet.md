To test Helio without real funds, you can use the Solana Devnet, Polygon, Base, or Ethereum Sepolia testnets.[1] First, log into Helio's development environment at app.dev.hel.io using a wallet like MetaMask or Phantom.[1] Then, connect your wallet to the desired test network in the "Settings -> Developer Settings" section.[1] You can then click "CREATE PAYMENT" to begin testing.[1] To make test payments, you will need to acquire test tokens from a faucet, such as the SOL faucet or USDC faucet.[1]
