# Fry - Backend Infrastructure & Blockchain Specialist

> "The IT Guy who keeps the gears turning behind the scenes"

## Overview

Fry is a Claude subagent (NOT user-facing) that provides comprehensive backend infrastructure and blockchain diagnostic support for all ElizaOS characters in the Football Squares ecosystem.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔧 Infrastructure Monitoring

- **Service Health**: Discord, Telegram, Twitter APIs, Database, RPC endpoints
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times, error rates, uptime monitoring
- **Automated Recovery**: Auto-restart services, failover mechanisms
- **Plugin Management**: ElizaOS plugin health and dependency tracking

### ⛓️ Blockchain Diagnostics

- **Wallet Issues**: Connection problems, balance checks, transaction history
- **Transaction Analysis**: Failed transactions, error log interpretation, balance changes
- **Smart Contract Health**: Anchor program deployment status, account verification
- **RPC Performance**: Network health, sync status, validator monitoring
- **Token Accounts**: SPL token detection, associated token accounts

### 🤝 Character Integration

- **Trainer Reviva**: Backend support for user troubleshooting
- **Coach B**: Technical issue escalation and routing
- **Dean Security**: Infrastructure security analysis
- **Commissioner Jerry**: Executive-level system status reporting

## Architecture

```
ElizaOS Characters → Fry Integration Layer → Diagnostic Engines
                                         ├── Infrastructure Monitor
                                         └── Blockchain Diagnostics
```

## Implementation

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import FryCharacterIntegration from './subagents/Fry/character-integration';

const fry = new FryCharacterIntegration({
  solanaRPC: process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL,
  monitoringIntervalMs: 30000, // 30 seconds
  alertThresholds: {
    responseTime: 2000, // 2 seconds
    errorRate: 0.05, // 5%
    uptimeMinimum: 99.5, // 99.5%
  },
});

// Start background monitoring
await fry.start();
```

### Character Support Usage

```typescript
// Trainer Reviva encounters a wallet issue
const supportResponse = await fry.supportCharacter({
  characterId: 'Trainer_Reviva',
  issue: 'User reports wallet connection failed',
  context: {
    userMessage: "My Phantom wallet won't connect",
    errorLogs: 'WalletConnectionError: Failed to connect',
    urgency: 'high',
  },
  expectedResponse: 'user_friendly',
});

// Fry analyzes and provides character-appropriate response
if (supportResponse.characterResponse.shouldRespond) {
  // Reviva uses Fry's suggested empathetic message
  await reviva.sendMessage(supportResponse.characterResponse.suggestedMessage);
}

if (supportResponse.characterResponse.escalationNeeded) {
  // Escalate to Dean if system issue detected
  await escalateToCharacter(supportResponse.characterResponse.escalateTo);
}
```

### Proactive Monitoring

```typescript
// Fry automatically detects issues and notifies characters
fry.on('criticalAlert', (alert) => {
  // Dean gets notified of security issues
  dean.handleSecurityAlert(alert);

  // Jerry gets executive summary
  jerry.receiveSystemAlert(alert);
});

fry.on('degradedAlert', (alert) => {
  // Characters adjust their responses for known issues
  reviva.enableDegradedModeSupport();
});
```

## Blockchain Diagnostic Examples

### Wallet Connection Issues

```typescript
const walletDiagnosis = await fry.blockchainDiag.diagnose({
  type: 'wallet',
  walletAddress: '7xK2...9mPq',
  errorMessage: 'Connection timeout',
});

// Results:
// - Wallet balance: 0.5 SOL
// - Recent transactions: 3 failed in last hour
// - Token accounts: 2 SPL tokens detected
// - Recommendation: Check RPC endpoint health
```

### Transaction Failures

```typescript
const txDiagnosis = await fry.blockchainDiag.diagnose({
  type: 'transaction',
  transactionHash: 'abc123...',
  expectedBehavior: 'Square purchase should succeed',
});

// Results:
// - Transaction status: Failed
// - Error: Insufficient balance for fees
// - Balance changes: None (transaction reverted)
// - User action: Add SOL for transaction fees
```

### Smart Contract Health

```typescript
const programDiagnosis = await fry.blockchainDiag.diagnose({
  type: 'program',
  programId: 'FootballSquaresProgramId',
});

// Results:
// - Program status: Deployed and executable
// - Data accounts: 1,247 active squares
// - Last interaction: 2 minutes ago
// - Health: Operational
```

## Character-Specific Response Patterns

### Trainer Reviva (Empathetic Support)

```
Input: "Wallet won't connect"
Fry Analysis: System RPC issue detected
Reviva Output: "Hey there! 🌱 I can see what's happening - this looks like it's on our end, not yours! Our backend team is already working on it..."
```

### Coach B (Sports Metaphors)

```
Input: "Transaction failed"
Fry Analysis: User insufficient balance
Coach B Output: "No problem! Every pro player runs into technical challenges. Let me hand you off to Trainer Reviva - she's our technical specialist..."
```

### Dean Security (Terse Technical)

```
Input: "Multiple RPC failures"
Fry Analysis: Critical infrastructure issue
Dean Output: "[2025-01-30 14:23:15] CRITICAL system issue detected. Solana RPC connection degraded. Automated remediation initiated. ETA resolution: 30 seconds."
```

### Commissioner Jerry (Executive Summary)

```
Input: "System-wide outage"
Fry Analysis: Multiple service failures
Jerry Output: "System issue identified and escalated to me:
• Root cause: RPC provider outage
• Impact: System-wide
• Resolution ETA: 5 minutes
• Resource allocation: Approved for immediate fix"
```

// Fry can diagnose Calculator RPC issues
if (calculatorError.includes('RPC')) {
  const diagnosis = await fry.diagnose({
    issue: 'Calculator RPC connection failed',
    system: 'rpc',
    urgency: 'high',
  });

  // Auto-switch to backup RPC if needed
  if (diagnosis.fixActions.some((f) => f.automated)) {
    await calculator.switchRPCEndpoint(diagnosis.backupRPC);
  }
}
```

### Dean Security Integration

```typescript
// Fry provides technical analysis for Dean's security scans
const securityFindings = await dean.runSecurityScan();
const infraAnalysis = await fry.getInfrastructureStatus();

// Correlate security findings with infrastructure health
const correlatedReport = dean.correlateFindingsWithInfra(
  securityFindings,
  infraAnalysis,
);
```

## Testing

```bash
# Test Fry infrastructure monitoring
pnpm test:fry:infrastructure

# Test blockchain diagnostics
pnpm test:fry:blockchain

# Test character integration
pnpm test:fry:characters

# Run comprehensive Fry test suite
pnpm test:fry:all
```

## Deployment Notes

- Fry runs as a background service alongside ElizaOS characters
- Requires Solana RPC endpoint access (mainnet recommended)
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL for monitoring data persistence
- Redis for caching and real-time alerts
- Docker container for isolated operation

## Monitoring & Alerts

Fry monitors itself and provides health metrics:

- System resource usage
- Diagnostic response times
- Character support request volume
- Infrastructure alert frequency
- Blockchain network performance
