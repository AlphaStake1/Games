Given our game revenue comes from SOL network activity, increasing exposure would concentrate risk. Think of it like a restaurant keeping most cash in the same currency as their customer payments - practical but not diversified.\n\nIf you want more upside exposure, consider DCA strategy with max 5% additional allocation over 4 weeks.\n\nTrust secured ✅",
