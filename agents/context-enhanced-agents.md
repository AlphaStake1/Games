## üèÜ HIGH PRIORITY - Game-Critical Agents

### 1. **BoardAgent** - Game State Context

**Current Issue**: Creates boards without understanding game timing, player capacity, or treasury state

```yaml
name: enhanced-board-agent
context_awareness:
  game_context:
    - nfl_schedule: Real game times and dates
    - active_boards: Current board capacity
    - treasury_balance: Can we cover potential payouts?
    - player_activity: Peak times for board creation
    - historical_data: Popular games and fill rates

  smart_decisions:
    - Auto-adjust square price based on game popularity
    - Prevent board creation if treasury can't cover max payout
    - Schedule board opening based on historical fill patterns
    - Dynamic capacity based on current player count

enhanced_logic:
  before_creating_board:
    - check: Treasury has 110% of max payout available
    - verify: Game time is >24 hours away
    - analyze: Similar games' fill rates
    - optimize: Set price based on demand prediction

  example_context_decision: |
    "Cowboys vs Eagles on Thanksgiving:
     - Historical fill rate: 97% in 2 hours
     - Recommended price: 0.15 SOL (50% above normal)
     - Treasury check: ‚úÖ 165 SOL available (need 100 SOL)
     - Auto-open: 72 hours before game"
```

### 2. **PayoutAgent** - Financial Context

**Current Issue**: Processes payouts without understanding treasury health or player history

```yaml
name: enhanced-payout-agent
context_awareness:
  financial_context:
    - treasury_balance: Current and projected
    - pending_payouts: Queue and priorities
    - player_reputation: Payout history and trust score
    - tax_implications: Reporting thresholds
    - fee_optimization: Network congestion awareness

  smart_decisions:
    - Batch payouts during low network fees
    - Priority queue for trusted players
    - Hold suspicious patterns for review
    - Reserve management (never go below 20% treasury)

enhanced_logic:
  before_payout:
    - check: Player has verified wallet (not fresh)
    - verify: Win is legitimate (no manipulation)
    - optimize: Batch with other payouts if gas high
    - maintain: Minimum treasury reserve

  risk_scoring:
    new_wallet_first_win: HIGH
    regular_player_normal_win: LOW
    unusual_pattern_detected: HOLD

example_decision: |
  "Payout request for 10 SOL:
   - Player trust score: 95/100 ‚úÖ
   - Treasury after payout: 45% ‚úÖ  
   - Network fees: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Decision: Queue for batch in 1 hour"
```

### 3. **RandomizerAgent** - Network & Security Context

**Current Issue**: Requests VRF without understanding network state or cost implications

```yaml
name: enhanced-randomizer-agent
context_awareness:
  network_context:
    - vrf_queue_depth: Current wait times
    - network_congestion: Solana TPS and fees
    - vrf_cost: Current price in SOL
    - backup_providers: Alternative randomness sources
    - security_level: Required randomness quality

  smart_decisions:
    - Use economy VRF for practice games
    - Premium VRF for high-stakes boards
    - Delay non-urgent randomization during congestion
    - Fallback strategies if Switchboard down

enhanced_logic:
  randomization_strategy:
    if: board_value < 10_SOL && network_congested
    then: queue_for_off_peak

    if: board_value > 100_SOL
    then: use_premium_vrf_immediate

    if: switchboard_timeout > 30_seconds
    then: activate_backup_provider

timing_optimization:
  peak_hours: "Delay non-critical VRF"
  off_peak: "Process queued requests"
  game_starting_soon: "Force immediate VRF"
```

## üéÆ MEDIUM PRIORITY - User Experience Agents

### 4. **OracleAgent** - Game & Timing Context

**Current Issue**: Polls scores without understanding game state or importance

    first_quarter: 2_minutes
    fourth_quarter_close_game: 30_seconds
    halftime: 10_minutes
    final: once_then_stop

enhanced_logic:
  adaptive_polling:
    - Close game + Q4: Maximum frequency
    - Blowout game: Reduce frequency
    - No active boards: Minimum polling
    - High-stakes board: Priority polling
```

### 5. **Coach B** - Player Context

**Current Issue**: Provides generic responses without knowing player history

```yaml

    vip_player: 'Priority support, exclusive insights'

  contextual_help:
    - Knows which board they're asking about
    - Remembers previous conversations
    - Suggests relevant features based on behavior
    - Celebrates their wins automatically
```

### 6. **Dean (Security)** - Threat Context

**Current Issue**: Scans everything equally without risk prioritization

```yaml
name: enhanced-dean-security
context_awareness:

  system_context:
    - active_users: Current load
    - ongoing_games: Don't deploy during Q4
    - treasury_operations: No deploy during payouts
    - network_status: Solana TPS and health
    - rollback_readiness: Can we revert quickly?

## üîÑ Quick Win Implementations

### 1. Treasury Safety (BoardAgent + PayoutAgent)

```typescript
// Before any financial operation
const context = {
  treasuryBalance: await getTreasuryBalance(),
  pendingPayouts: await getPendingPayouts(),
  minimumReserve: config.MINIMUM_TREASURY_RESERVE,
  canProceed: treasuryBalance - pendingPayouts > minimumReserve,
};
```

### 2. Network Awareness (RandomizerAgent + OracleAgent)

```typescript
// Check network before expensive operations
const networkContext = {
  currentTPS: await getSolanaTPS(),
  avgFee: await getAverageFee(),
  vrfQueueDepth: await getVRFQueueSize(),
  optimalTiming: findLowCongestionWindow(),
};
```

### 3. Player Intelligence (Coach B + Dean)

```typescript
// Build player context for personalized experience
const playerContext = {
  trustScore: calculateTrustScore(wallet),
  history: await getPlayerHistory(wallet),
  currentBoards: await getActiveBoards(wallet),
  communicationPreference: await getPlayerPrefs(wallet),
  riskProfile: assessPlayerRisk(wallet),
};
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start with BoardAgent** - Prevent treasury drain
2. **Enhance PayoutAgent** - Add risk scoring
3. **Upgrade GM Jerry** - Full system visibility
4. **Add context layer** - Shared context service for all agents

These enhancements would prevent issues like:

- Creating boards when treasury is low
- Paying out to suspicious wallets
- Wasting money on VRF during network congestion
- Missing critical security threats
- Poor user experience from generic responses
