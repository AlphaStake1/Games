Could you help me understand:\n\n• What type of partnership are you envisioning?\n• What's your target audience/demographic?\n• What success metrics matter most to you?\n• Timeline you're working with?\n\nOnce I understand your goals, I can put together a custom proposal that creates real value for both sides. Looking forward to exploring this!"

Quick question though - are you looking for:\n\n□ Brand visibility during games?\n□ Community engagement opportunities?\n□ Data/analytics partnership?\n□ Custom integration?\n\nThis helps me tailor the package options to what matters most for your campaign. I'll also include some case studies from similar partnerships that drove great results. Sound good?"
